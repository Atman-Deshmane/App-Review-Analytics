### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Feature Parity:** Accelerate the development and deployment of high-impact dashboard features, specifically the unified "Total Asset Value" view and the inclusion of the GIFT Nifty index, to satisfy sophisticated user demands.
2.  **Conduct Real-Time Data Audit:** Initiate an immediate technical audit of live trading data feeds to investigate and resolve reports of data lag and multi-screen data divergence, which is severely impacting trust among active traders.
3.  **Leverage MF Automation Success:** Utilize the positive narrative surrounding effortless mutual fund migration and auto-retrieval (Theme 5) in upcoming marketing campaigns to acquire users frustrated with managing legacy MF portfolios.

## Weekly App Review Pulse: App Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 24 Nov 2025 to 06 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
Trading Features continue to dominate user feedback with the highest impact score, driven by requests for enhanced technical indicators. While App Performance has seen significant praise, particularly for its user-friendly UI, critical issues around "Charges and Fees" and slower customer support response times are impacting user experience and financial outcomes.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

*   **Trading Features (Impact Score: 10211, Review Count: 15):** This theme remains the most impactful, indicating that users are actively seeking more advanced tools within the app. The primary request revolves around the addition of specific indicators like "stochastic indicator," highlighting a need for more sophisticated charting and analysis capabilities to support trading decisions.

*   **App Performance (Impact Score: 3848, Review Count: 18):** App Performance is a strong performer, with a significant number of reviews praising the app's ease of use, particularly for beginners. The UI is frequently cited as a key strength, making it a preferred choice over competitors. However, the impact score, while high, is significantly lower than Trading Features, suggesting that while the app is functional and user-friendly, feature enhancements are a higher priority for user satisfaction and engagement.

*   **Customer Support (Impact Score: 218, Review Count: 6):** Despite a lower review count and impact score, the feedback on Customer Support is nuanced. While the AI Voice Assistant is praised for its speed and efficiency, human interaction is perceived as slow and cumbersome. This suggests an opportunity to streamline the human support process to match the speed of the AI, or to further enhance the AI's capabilities to handle a wider range of queries.

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   **"please add stochastic indicator, which is very useful"** (Votes: 5731, Theme: Trading Features) - This quote directly reflects the dominant user demand within the "Trading Features" theme, highlighting a clear gap in analytical tools.

*   **"it's been 1.5 years I am using groww. However since then till now they have improved a lot. They have improved their UI which is very easy for beginners. I prefer this app over any other investment apps coz of it's simple UI. I have invested in stocks and mutual fund through this app as the steps were very easy. A beginner can easily understand how to use this app and even portfolio tracking is also very easy using this app."** (Votes: 3576, Theme: App Performance) - This quote exemplifies the strong positive sentiment towards the app's performance and user-friendliness, a key differentiator for the platform.

*   **"The app is good, but the call center experience isn’t. I prefer your AI Voice Assistant because it solves my problem in just 30–50 seconds. In a human call, I first have to enter my date of birth, then select options based on my issue, and only after that do I get connected to a representative. The whole process takes around 7–8 minutes. The speed should be faster. In the end, my problem was solved. Thank you."** (Votes: 149, Theme: Customer Support) - This quote effectively captures the dichotomy in customer support, highlighting the success of AI while pointing out a significant area for improvement in human agent interaction speed.

### 3. Recommended Actions

*   **Prioritize Development of Advanced Trading Indicators:** Allocate resources to research and implement requested indicators like "stochastic" to enhance the app's appeal to more experienced traders and meet the demand for sophisticated analytical tools.
*   **Investigate and Streamline Human Customer Support Processes:** Analyze the bottlenecks in the human call center experience and implement changes to reduce the time taken to connect users to a representative, aiming to match the speed and efficiency of the AI Voice Assistant.
*   **Conduct a Transparent Review of "Charges and Fees" Discrepancies:** Address the user concern regarding "hidden charges" and discrepancies in P&L calculations. Initiate a thorough review of fee structures and communication to ensure clarity and build user trust.

## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 01, 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Feature Gap Poses Highest Risk:** The highest user demand, indicated by an overwhelming impact score (19,185) and high quote votes (9,651), centers on missing core trading tools, specifically the **Gift Nifty Index** and a unified **Total Asset View (Stocks + MFs)**. This is a critical competitive parity issue requiring immediate roadmap prioritization.
*   **IPO Reliability Lagging Competitors:** App reliability issues are heavily concentrated in the time-sensitive IPO application process. Users report the process stalling ("sending application to exchange"), naming competitors (AngelOne, INDmoney) as faster and more reliable, creating significant user frustration during high-stakes moments.
*   **UX Remains a Key Strength, But Charges Need Transparency:** Overall user experience (UI/UX) continues to receive high praise, confirming Groww’s ease-of-use competitive advantage. However, friction points persist around fees, particularly where small profits are perceived as being fully negated by high brokerage charges, necessitating improved transparency in the trade confirmation flow.

### Top 5 Themes (Ranked by User Impact)

| Theme Name | Community Impact Score (Total Thumbs Up) | Voice of the Customer | Quote Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Trading Tools** | 19,185 | "Please provide a 'Total asset tab' in the home page which should show the total investment amount in both stocks + mutual funds. 2. Gift nifty index is not there ok groww. other brokers app is showing gift nifty index. kindly provide that too.." | (Votes: 9,651) |
| **App Reliability & Speed** | 11,251 | "This is one of the best platforms for investment, but applying for an IPO is frustrating. Recently, the application process gets stuck on 'sending application to exchange,' failing to generate a number or send a mandate. Other platforms like AngelOne and INDmoney are much faster..." | (Votes: 1,998) |
| **Other** (Primarily Positive Feedback) | 10,293 | "I have opened a demat account using this app & it is very easy... The user-friendly interface makes investing hassle-free, while real-time tracking ensures transparency. I love the zero-commission feature and fast withdrawals. Highly recommend this app." | (Votes: 3,574) |
| **High Fees & Hidden Charges** | 1,939 | "...the brokerage charges feel a bit high — even when I get ₹2–₹3 profit, ₹10–₹20 gets deducted, which is frustrating. Please fix this issue, otherwise Groww is really one of the best and most user-friendly trading apps!" | (Votes: 873) |
| **Poor Customer Support** | 1,589 | "I have tried multiple apps for my investment, but one thing I like the most about Groww is their easy interface... And their customer support team is also very cooperative and helpful. really deserved a 5 star!!" | (Votes: 338) |

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Feature Parity Sprint (Missing Trading Tools):** Immediately assign the highest engineering bandwidth to closing the feature gap identified by the community's top request. This includes launching the **Gift Nifty Index** and a **unified "Total Asset" dashboard view** that aggregates stock and mutual fund holdings on the home screen within the next 4 weeks to counter competitive pressure.
2.  **Launch IPO Critical Path Optimization:** Initiate a focused "Reliability Sprint" to stress-test and optimize the IPO application pipeline and exchange submission module. The objective must be achieving best-in-class speed and stability, eliminating the failure point where applications stall on "sending application to exchange," especially under peak load (e.g., the final day of an IPO window).
3.  **Enhance Fee Transparency for Small Trades:** Revise the pre-execution order confirmation screen to provide a clearer, more prominent line-item breakdown of all charges (brokerage, STT, transaction tax, etc.) for trades resulting in low profits. This will manage user expectations regarding net returns and reduce frustration associated with the "High Fees & Hidden Charges" theme.

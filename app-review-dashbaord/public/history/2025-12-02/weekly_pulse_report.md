## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 02, 2025

### Executive Summary
*   **Feature Parity Risk is Critical:** "Missing Features & Tools" dominates user dissatisfaction this week with an extremely high impact score (20,638). Users are demanding fundamental portfolio management capabilities—specifically an aggregated "Total Assets" tab (Stocks + MFs) and the immediate addition of the **GIFT Nifty Index** for market tracking.
*   **Mission-Critical IPO Reliability Failure:** The second highest concern focuses on App Speed and Glitches (11,373 impact score), driven by reports of the IPO application process stalling consistently at the "sending application to exchange" stage, leading to friction and competitive comparison against faster platforms like AngelOne.
*   **UI/UX Remains a Core Moat:** Despite operational friction, the majority of positive sentiment (captured largely in the "Other" theme) highlights Groww's superior UI/UX, easy interface, and simple navigation, confirming that the platform's beginner-friendly design is still its primary competitive advantage.

| **Missing Features & Tools** | 20,638 | "Please provide a 'Total asset tab' in the home page which should show the total investment amount in both stocks + mutual funds. 2.

| **App Speed and Glitches** | 11,373 | "This is one of the best platforms for investment, but applying for an IPO is frustrating.

| **High Charges & Fees** | 1,626 | "Best experience overall! But I faced one issue... Also, the brokerage charges feel a bit high — even when I get ₹2–₹3 profit, ₹10–₹20 gets deducted, which is frustrating." | (Votes: 884) |

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Close Feature Parity Gaps Immediately:** Prioritize the development and Q1 2026 deployment of the integrated "Total Assets View" (Stocks + Mutual Funds) on the home screen. Simultaneously, fast-track the integration of the **GIFT Nifty index feed** to mitigate competitive feature disadvantages noted by sophisticated users.
2.  **Ensure Critical Transaction Reliability:** Launch a high-priority, dedicated engineering sprint to diagnose and fix the latency issue causing the IPO application to stall at the "sending application to exchange" stage. This operational glitch damages user trust during time-sensitive events and creates churn risk toward faster competitors.
3.  **Enhance Fee Transparency:** Address the perception that small trading profits are unfairly eroded by charges. Review and redesign the trade summary screen or P&L report to clearly itemize all statutory charges, taxes, and brokerage fees deducted, ensuring users fully understand the total cost basis of the transaction, especially when dealing with minimal gains.

## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing

**Reporting Period:** (This Week)

### 1. Executive Summary

*   **Polarized Sentiment:** High praise continues for the ease of account opening and regulatory operations, but this is critically undermined by reports of core platform instability (order failures).
*   **Feature Demand Surge:** The most impactful feedback (24k votes) centers on demands for advanced trading tools and consolidation of asset views (e.g., single 'Total Asset Tab').
*   **Critical Stability Alert:** Immediate action is required to resolve transaction failures, specifically concerning delayed order placements and frustratingly stuck IPO application submissions.

### 3. Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Address Transaction Integrity (Themes 4 & 5):** Immediately prioritize and resolve the root causes of order execution failures (sell errors) and the recurring "stuck" IPO application status to safeguard user trust and capital.
2.  **Consolidate Dashboard View (Theme 1):** Fast-track the development and deployment of a unified 'Total Assets' dashboard feature that aggregates Stock, Mutual Fund, and F&O investments for quick access and comprehensive portfolio overview.
3.  **Enhance Feature Parity (Themes 1 & 3):** Expedite the addition of key professional features like Gift Nifty indexing and continue refinement of the Portfolio Analyser tools to maintain competitiveness against peer brokerage platforms.

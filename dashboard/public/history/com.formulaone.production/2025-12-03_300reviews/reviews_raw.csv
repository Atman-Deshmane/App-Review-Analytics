2025-11-10 00:51:34,1,"still terrible. They now spoil every race showing the podium as the title screen for the race. Imbeciles. Changing the view to a specific driver causes the stream to reset to zero, and my mostly fail to show the driver cam (like verstappen today - silverstone). so amateurish for the price, not worth it.",65,
2025-10-14 15:22:47,1,"newest version is less intuitive. now when I navigate away from the app - for a call, message, photo, etc. I can't just reopen and continue where I was - it restarts the app and starts at the main screen and I have to find what I was watching and hope it restarts where I left off (it usually doesn't). even a ""recently watched"" tab would be helpful. still no PiP function for >$100/year. this will be my last year paying",48,
2025-09-22 13:31:30,4,"Great app with one big wish. I love the F1TV app—great coverage, access to practice sessions, and all the behind-the-scenes content. My only wish is to have a “No Spoiler Mode” or an option to turn off auto-play. Sometimes I’m catching up on practice or qualifying and the app jumps straight into the race replay, which ruins the suspense. Other than that, the app is excellent and a must-have for F1 fans. Add a spoiler-free mode, and it’s an easy 5 stars!",34,
2025-10-15 00:30:11,5,"The app works great on my phone and on my Roku stick. With that out there, the layout and programming choices are not good at all. There is no guide with times to upcoming races,FP's or quali. Most of the bonus stuff like support races is only available live, it's not archived and the absolute worst is having to change streams from pre race, to race, to post race. Seriously? We know Liberty Media are greedy F'ers but that is just lazy. It's 2025, do better.",29,
2025-09-20 12:37:00,1,"no option to select video playback quality which was there previously. my wifi is capable of 4k playback but f1tv is not even able to do 1080p for baku qualifying. why do remove the useful things. with all the technology f1 has, it can't produce a decent app for it's fans. disappointing!",27,
2025-11-08 14:44:39,1,Great idea and app when it works. But super laggy and worst app to watch F1 on a smart TV. Only streaming app that constantly and consistently lags and buffers during live coverage. Almost useless like this. Cannot understand that they cannot fix this.,23,
2025-10-11 22:33:14,5,"Great app. easy to use and can watch any of the practice, qualifying, or race coverage when u want. It also has a substantial amount of the race footage from prior years so if you are new or want to see some of the great races from the past, they are there.",21,
2025-10-26 19:30:15,3,"Consistently getting less while being charged more. Became a fan because of Netflix, paid for a premium experience at a premium price and it was AWESOME, then you charged me more and gave me less. now you're selling out to Apple TV. It's little exclusive deals like this that make it harder and harder for me to see what I want to see and is why I don't watch Indy anymore. If next year sucks with apple, I'm out. Greed ruins the customer experience.",18,

This is the only meaningfull part of the apps description if your going to do exactly what an app put on the Google play store should do, WORK ON ANDROID! What an absolute joke how long this has even been a thing , especially coming from F1 who puts so much into RND! They should be embarrassed. ""if it dont make dollars it dont make cents""",16,

I don't always need it because we watch on our TV at home BUT sometimes when we travel or I am farm sitting I watch on my Chromebook while my husband watches at home.

2025-10-26 09:42:32,1,"Keep getting kicked out of the stream. Multiple race weekends in a row I've tried to log out all devices. Does not help.

It's absolute garbage.",11,
2025-10-18 05:40:56,1,"Absolute nonsense to force paying customers to use another service in the future. I paid for F1 TV because I only want F1 coverage, not all of the trash that is AppleTV, no matter how much money Apple paid for it. Garbage move that will kill F1 for me.",3,

2025-10-04 07:31:01,1,"Paying so much money per year and having such a bad app is a disgrace. Streaming has a delay and sometimes it doesn't even start playing. So when I'm out I can't watch the race. Happening on multiple androids so it's really time to fix this issue! Oh, and you should make an app for PlayStation to stream on there (just a thought).",2,

2025-10-26 22:11:34,1,"Very buggy, for being a sports app the last thing you need is constant crashes, links that don't work. Every time I use the app there's a new bug which means I go back and forth until it starts working. Honestly for the price only worth it because they have a monopoly, I hope Apple tv rights come to where I live and I can use their service instead, I've dealt with this terrible experience for too long.",2,

2025-10-17 17:09:43,1,"Says I have too many devices, wont let me login. You should be blocking the streaming instead of the logins.... But this app will become useless after December. F1 is going to be an AppleTV exclusive! i'm sure McLaren sponsor Google is thrilled!",1,

2025-10-20 14:23:03,2,"This app is frustrating. The TV app and the phone app don't work together. If you watch some of a race on your phone and get home and want to resume from where you were on your TV, you can't - start over. Often, from the TV app you click on the ""resume show,"" and it starts the show over, which is annoying. Locating the various shows like ""post race show"" sometimes is difficult. It makes you hunt for it. I do like how the races are later organized on the app, that is nice. No adds - great!",1,
2025-10-26 00:49:58,1,"Dog butt app. for how much money F1 rakes in every single year they should be able to afford a better app. you can't even cast the footage, live or playback, onto a smart TV. there isn't a button for casting. plain and simple.",1,
2025-10-26 13:36:49,5,love this app it is by far my favorite way to watch F1 with great shows and documentaries and all of the races from the past they have in the archives is just wonderful,1,
2025-10-26 22:05:14,2,I experience a lot of issues with casting (chromecast) while internet and wifi are no issues. It needs a lot of buffering. Forced to watch through my laptop these days.,1,
2025-11-12 17:18:45,1,"It's 2025 and this app is still garbage. Constant video playback errors and network errors. To fix you have to force close the app, turn airplane mode on and back off, re-open the app, find the race, and skip forward to where you were in the race as it doesn't remember where you left off.",1,
2025-11-20 23:56:03,1,"App forced an update on me yesterday. Haven't been able to watch a single thing since. Tried across multiple devices, different times of day, wifi, data etc. Nothing works. Very annoying as we go into the start of a triple header and I'm stuck watching delayed, abbreviated content with ads on YouTube. Subscription will be canceled if it doesn't come right this weekend.",1,
2025-11-21 18:33:33,4,Was a fan until I found out I wont be able to use the app when the deal with Apple starts. Looks like I will be taking at least a 5 year break.,1,
2025-11-23 05:49:34,1,"It was ok, but the last update has stuffed it. Constantly hangs and now has buffing issues. 23 Nov 2025: Still the same click rubbish asks ""Watch live"" or ""Watch from start"" so you click ""Watch from start"" and what does it do starts live every time and now I have seen the results ...",1,
2025-11-23 12:09:36,3,"Well, it's paid for, so the content that it provides is definitely premium. However, there are way too many areas for improvement.

2025-11-24 11:57:08,1,"fix your app. After the last update nothing runs smoothly. lagging, glitchy, kicked out mid race. love the sport and everything around it but not the tv app",1,
2025-11-24 12:14:04,2,if you want to watch drivers girlfriends live.. commentators are good app is good. issue is witg tv director missing all the action cutting to girlfriends and celebrities. no paying customers want that most recent race missed all the action including Lando slowing down and albon front wing in the pit. fire the tv race director or give a live channel without the BS,1,
2025-11-24 18:47:35,3,Don't fall for the 4K option they can only broadcast at 1080p. I should have known this beforehand because 4K broadcasting isnt widespread yet. Don't make the same mistake.,1,

2025-09-20 11:51:06,2,"Great app but this update buffers awfully no matter what I do. Very distracting, VERY disappointing. The app sign in constantly fails to let me back into my paid subscription. Clearing caches, background apps, etc etc doesn't help at all. Uninstalling and reinstalling is a large pain in the *** too and still didn't help. This is far too expensive to be this frustrating. And BTW, if I choose the video quality level that I want I probably want THAT (and not Auto), right? So just leave it then!",0,
2025-09-20 19:14:30,1,"Infuriatingly horrible user interface. I dare anyone who's familiar with Netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime or any other streaming video app to try pausing and then restartimg playback without screaming and wanting to tear their hair out.

2025-09-22 08:02:01,4,A little hard to navigate as the layout does not seem intuitive to me. But I love having the races streamed and the alerts and other extras. I think it is a great value if you are a fan.,0,
2025-10-05 13:01:26,1,"Only streaming app on my systems that keeps on lagging and buffering. When it works, it's brilliant. But its annoying that this app constantly lags. And no, its not my connection/cache/etc... edit: getting worse instead of better.",0,
2025-10-05 14:01:08,4,"overall fine but there are parts that can be inproved. not sure if there is a difference between the android app and the fire tv app, but the app for fire it's difficult to switch to intl broadcast. sometimes it works but always restarts the race or it's muted. takes multiple tries.",0,
2025-10-05 15:41:38,1,"Worst playback functionality for any streaming app I have ever used. When you want to start from the beginning of the race when it is live it will jump to the live point and spoil the start. Constant lag, no TV app availability.

2025-10-17 17:22:21,1,Requiring Apple TV in the future is ridiculous. The whole point of F1 streaming service is not having to be bundled with cable or any other subscription we are not interested in. This move is extremely disappointing.,0,
2025-10-17 17:40:07,1,"F1TV was great, but be warned prices will go up as they have a contract for 2026-2031 with AppleTV for users in thr US. You will now need to subscribe to Appletv which is significantly more expensive and will probably feature ads.",0,

2025-11-22 04:43:59,1,I can't download the app to my tv. I can't stream from my phone to my tv. what is the point of streaming this service if I have to watch it on my tiny phone screen or on my pc. I like to watch the races with my family.,0,
2025-11-22 07:21:46,3,"It spoils the results on the thumbnails every time before I can watch the race (I cannot watch it live). I want to watch without knowing the ending!!! And I want to see a simlple list of the videos, not that messy mashup of everything.",0,

2025-11-25 03:16:25,1,"Can't cast onto chrome cast. Now, it is no longer just a subscription to F1 races. You need to sign up for apple tv if you don't have one of those. I do not have an apple tv subscription. In a world where everything is going subscription based these days I refuse to sign up for a new one for one i had already signed up for. Good luck formula one staff!",0,
2025-11-28 18:10:23,1,"Horrible app. Always lags, so difficult to cast.",0,

2025-11-29 13:41:48,3,"Too many small problems for an app that is as expensive as this. On certain devices it's not possible to change certain commentaries. Rarely remembers where i was exactly in a video, so i always have to guess where i was and causes sometimes for certain spoilers. Sometimes glitches when i press +/- 10 sec to 30 minutes later or so, again, spoiling things. The quality is great though and enjoy all the details i get but these glitches have been here for years and should be fixed.",0,

2025-11-29 14:20:50,1,Worst app update of the year. App sometimes get stuck on the ref F1 logo screen. and then on livestream it stops playing midway. at first I thought it was my internet but it wasn't. what's the point of paying for this service if I can't use it ON A FRIGGIN RACE DAY!!!!!,0,

2025-11-29 15:47:27,3,The app is not that easy to navigate. I wanted chronological sorting of every video but I couldn't do it. The video also doesn't auto-orient when I rotate my phone when I need to charge it. We also need offline downloads to be available. Data is not cheap in this country.

2025-11-29 18:29:34,1,"A vibe coding 13 year old can pump out a better app in a few days. Every app can see a streaming device, f1 app only shows the device on random occasions. Press watch live, no option watch from start, BLAM podium ceremony in your face. no WebOS app, Android tv on mibox s is a lagfest and unwatchable. Closing app and restarting to see new content. casting sometimes give the option to set audio language but not always. The player interface is just zero effort, app looks like a PoC",0,

2025-11-29 19:16:49,2,"Works well when you watch replays or watching live. The reason for 2 stars is the app will jump to LIVE when casting from tablet or phone, ruining the race/qualifying when jumping in after the start of the session.

2025-11-30 00:00:57,2,App is Ok but not great. The streaming quality is very poor for a premium service. Constant buffering or quality degradation for both live and replay of sessions despite having a high speed internet connection. Can almost forgive this for live streaming but absolutely no reason this should occur for replay streams if designed well.,0,
2025-11-30 13:42:38,1,it is so buggy. it looks and feels like an app developed in 2009 . crashes when I change screen orientation. crops hair the screen sometimes. has a mind of its own. with all the$$$ f1 is raking in one world think they'd put some thought into making an app that works,0,
2025-11-30 16:09:50,1,"this app is garbage, especially when streaming to a chrome cast. you are lucky to watch 2 laps of live racing before the stream just freezing and doing nothing.",0,

It only works for about 5 min at a time and then kicks me off. This has been happening all year and still isn't fixed. This app has never worked properly and has gotten way too expensive for the amount of errors it has.,0,
2025-11-30 18:18:52,1,Extremely expensive and the app feels like it's in a beta stage. I guess that's one of the perks of a monopoly. Update: November 2025 - casting doesn't work for races but you can cast other content. I am ashamed of myself for paying for such an abhorrent service,0,

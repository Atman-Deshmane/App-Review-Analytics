## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 03, 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Critical UX Failure (Spoilers):** User sentiment is dominated by a major flaw in App Navigation and spoiler presentation, which accounts for 68% of the total recorded impact this period (Score 195). The community urgently needs a functional, spoiler-free user experience.
*   **Core Technical Degradation:** Streaming quality remains a high-friction point (Impact Score 63), driven specifically by the removal of manual video quality selection (e.g., 4K/1080p control), leading to perceived lag and inconsistent playback even on strong networks.
*   **Value Erosion Risk:** Negative perception of value for money is spiking due to high-profile issues (lag, mandatory device switches) and the impending shift toward Apple TV exclusivity, which users view as charging more while providing less access and utility.

### Top 5 Themes (Ranked by User Impact)

| Rank | Theme Name | Community Impact Score (Total Thumbs Up) | Voice of the Customer | Quote Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **App Navigation & Spoilers** | **195** | "still terrible. They now spoil every race showing the podium as the title screen for the race. Imbeciles. Changing the view to a specific driver causes the stream to reset to zero..." | (Votes: 65) |
| **2** | **Streaming Lag & Buffering** | **63** | "no option to select video playback quality which was there previously. my wifi is capable of 4k playback but f1tv is not even able to do 1080p for baku qualifying. why do remove the useful things." | (Votes: 27) |
| **3** | Other (Includes Positive Feedback) | 56 | "Great app. easy to use and can watch any of the practice, qualifying, or race coverage when u want. It also has a substantial amount of the race footage from prior years..." | (Votes: 21) |
| **4** | **Mandatory Apple TV Switch** | 23 | "Consistently getting less while being charged more... now you're selling out to Apple TV. It's little exclusive deals like this that make it harder and harder for me to see what I want to see..." | (Votes: 18) |
| **5** | **Login and Payment Problems** | 13 | "Keep getting kicked out of the stream. Multiple race weekends in a row I've tried to log out all devices. Does not help... even though only one is logged in). This app goed from one problem to the next." | (Votes: 11) |

### Strategic Recommendations

#### 1. Zero-Tolerance for Spoilers & Navigation Stability (Priority 1)
*   **Action:** Immediately task the UX team with implementing a **Mandatory Spoiler-Free Mode** default for all users accessing the Race Hub and Replay content.
*   **Verification:** Conduct rigorous QA to eliminate navigation bugs that reset streams when switching cameras or drivers, a basic functionality failure that frustrates dedicated viewers.

#### 2. Restore Manual Quality Control and Stabilize Playback (Priority 2)
*   **Action:** Prioritize the re-introduction of manual video quality selection (1080p/4K toggle) to allow high-bandwidth users to override inconsistent auto-selection logic.
*   **Engineering Focus:** Launch a deep diagnostic into recent streaming consistency degradation, specifically targeting the cause of 1080p performance failure reported during peak events, regardless of user WiFi capacity.

#### 3. Proactive Communication on Platform Changes and Value
*   **Action:** Develop a clear, preemptive communications campaign addressing the Apple TV switch concern. This campaign must articulate the *benefit* to the user, not just the mandatory change, to offset the narrative that the platform is "selling out" and reducing value.
*   **Stabilization Prerequisite:** Before the Apple TV switch, eliminate long-standing Login/Device Management errors (Theme 5) as these technical annoyances amplify user hostility towards platform changes.

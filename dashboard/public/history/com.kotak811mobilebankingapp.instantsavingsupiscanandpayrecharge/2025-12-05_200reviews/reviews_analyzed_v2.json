It was such a bad experience, other banks would take forever especially Indus bank is trash, their customer service is negligible, the app doesn't even work. And yesterday I tried this bank, didn't even had to go anywhere one of the few banks whose website or app works no lags or bugs. Opened my bank account in like 30 mins remote and even the kyc was done by evening ( 8 hrs max)",

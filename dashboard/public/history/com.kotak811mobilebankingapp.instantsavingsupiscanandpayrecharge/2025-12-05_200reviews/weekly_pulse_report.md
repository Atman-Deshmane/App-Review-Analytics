## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.kotak811mobilebankingapp.instantsavingsupiscanandpayrecharge Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 05 Oct 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The primary focus of user conversation remains highly concentrated on **Login Issues & App Stability** (4488 Impact Score), though the most visible review within this theme offers strong praise for our streamlined account opening process compared to competitors. However, significant friction persists in two critical areas: Feature Parity (users are forced to switch between the 811 and older apps) and a systemic failure in **Poor Customer Support**, particularly when dealing with account blocks and unauthorized financial deductions.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Login Issues & App Stability** | 4488 | 59 | While this is the highest volume theme, the top-voted feedback (1599 votes) validates our core value proposition—ease of digital account opening and stability versus competition. Product focus should ensure this stability holds, as the high review count suggests underlying issues are still driving discussion. |
| **2** | **Missing Features & Design** | 2153 | 34 | User friction is high due to feature disparity between the 811 app and the legacy app. Specifically, high-utility features like Credit Score checking are forcing users to log in/out, directly hindering the seamless 811 experience we promote. **Feature parity is critical for adoption.** |
| **3** | **Poor Customer Support** | 1222 | 24 | The reported experience illustrates a severe breakdown in the support workflow, where users with blocked accounts are advised to visit a branch or recharge their accounts just to contact support. This process is highly frustrating and poses an extreme risk to customer retention and trust. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote | Impact (Votes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login Issues & App Stability** | "Amazing! I recently came back from NY and I had to open a bank account... The app works no lags or bugs. Opened my bank account in like 30 mins remote and even the kyc was done by evening ( 8 hrs max)" | 1599 |
| **Missing Features & Design** | "User friendly. But many features are not yet available in this app, such as checking credit score... So we have to log in to our old app sometimes, log out and log in to the new app, we are facing a lot of problems." | 696 |
| **Poor Customer Support** | "It's my very bad and worst experience with Kotak. There is no customer support for any type of complaint. My account has been blocked for 2 weeks... they advised me for a talktime recharge to contact customer care. But still it's very disappointing." | 410 |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize 811 Feature Parity:** Immediately fast-track the integration of key missing features (e.g., Credit Score check and other self-service utilities) into the 811 app to eliminate the current workflow requiring users to switch between applications.
2.  **Restructure Blocked Account Resolution:** Audit and restructure the blocked account escalation protocol. Implement a 24/7 dedicated digital channel (in-app chat/email) for resolving critical issues like account blocks, ensuring users are not required to recharge mobile talktime or visit a branch for initial support.
3.  **Investigate Unauthorized Deductions:** Launch an urgent investigation into the "Unexpected Charges & Blocks" theme (617 Impact Score), specifically resolving all outstanding cases related to unauthorized debits for insurance policies or unfulfilled welcome kit fees, ensuring immediate refunds where applicable.

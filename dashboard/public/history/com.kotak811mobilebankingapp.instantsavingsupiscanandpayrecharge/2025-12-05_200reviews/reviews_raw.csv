2025-10-14 08:33:16,5,"Amazing! I recently came back from NY and I had to open a bank account. It was such a bad experience, other banks would take forever especially Indus bank is trash, their customer service is negligible, the app doesn't even work. And yesterday I tried this bank, didn't even had to go anywhere one of the few banks whose website or app works no lags or bugs. Opened my bank account in like 30 mins remote and even the kyc was done by evening ( 8 hrs max)",1599,
2025-11-08 12:41:14,5,"Kotak Mahindra Bank's 811 app. User friendly. But many features are not yet available in this app, so there are many difficulties, such as checking credit score, some facilities are not yet available in this app. So we have to log in to our old app sometimes, log out and log in to the new app, we are facing a lot of problems.

2025-10-12 14:46:06,1,It's my very bad and worst experience with Kotak. There is no customer support for any type of complaint. My account has been blocked for 2 weeks then I visited the kotak branch and they advised me for a talktime recharge to contact customer care. But still it's very disappointing. This is also not helpful. I'm visiting a branch and they are refusing to help with this and also the Kotak app is not helping. I don't know what to do now. I'm very frustrated. It's very disappointing for a customer.,410,

2025-11-30 07:15:05,5,"the most fastest way of transfering money. for daily uses under 20k. 1. highly efficient 2. they give cashback for real, not scratch'n ""betterluck next time"".😄 3. Minimal interface, not much integration there. 4. such a basic version, ease to quick move around. Still a good working model of beta version with good interface. The only thing i want you to update is the forget password area, where you ask mothers maiden name- which was an autogenated from what we enter in your format.",203,

The account was opened today itself within about three hours. So far it's going well, don't know what's next I am writing this review later, so I want to say that after using it for some time, I realized that more work needs to be done on the UI of the app. It seems that the process is slow, please fix it.",184,
2025-11-02 08:43:30,5,"I’ve criticized the old Kotak 811 app before but the new one is a massive upgrade! The design looks modern, sleek and minimal exactly how a digital banking app should be in 2025. Everything feels clean, fast and easy to use.

It’s one of the best banking apps when it comes to reliability and user experience. No doubt, Kotak is among the best in digital banking. But still, the IDFC FIRST Bank app remains my number one for its unmatched performance and ease of use! 👏✨",128,
2025-10-29 15:10:57,4,"One of the best banking apps, but it has some issues. 1) You should remove suggestions for you from the home tab, as it already has its own separate tab called ""Offers."" 2) Remove the scan QR tab from the bottom menu section, as the app landing page already has a big pay button. Rather, make the circle a scan square logo. Minimalism is the key guys, and you people have almost nailed it. cheers",121,
2025-10-27 07:17:49,1,"Very bad service! I had a dream different credit card. I wanted to increase my credit limit, so I booked an FD. But after booking the FD, I was unable to increase my credit limit because Kotak said there were some technical issues in their system and asked me to wait for a week. Now, even after one month, the same issue has not been resolved. Shame on you, Kotak Mahindra Bank",120,
2025-10-19 22:22:11,1,Dear Friends I have purchased the kotak iocl credit card past two months back. I have had an worst ever service from them. They have promised that every 150 rupees fuel spent you will get 24 rewards points and 1% surcharge waiver. They never given the both parameters on statement Each and every time we have to call customer service that my rewards points not added properly and also for surcharge waiver.

2025-10-31 05:33:20,1,It is not user friendly so there are many mess/clumsy in the app we need to search every time for an different option. The app should be different USer friendly so that any knowledge less person also should be able to use. previous version was good and easy navigation. This is not a website to make over clumsy specially this is a banking app it should be clear and concise. As myself educated I feel difficult to use and it is making more time to spend on it feels like close the account by seeing.,62,

2025-11-04 17:52:02,3,exceptional app with very weird bill payment reward structure. it's a very smooth and almost bug free app with very convenient features which very few banks offer BUT in the bill payment section under credit cards you can find almost all issuers but not kotak itself and if you pay bill via the app's credit card section you won't be rewarded the cashback. so I would suggest that if you are rewarding for other credit card bill payments then please implement same for your own credit card.,60,
2025-10-09 11:27:27,5,"I am happy that my complaint was heard and action was taken and my refund was also returned. Thank you Team Kotak. You have always heard and acted upon my requests.

In today’s digital era, a bank app should make life easier, not create stress.It’s not a one-time issue. This has been happening again and again.

Then, halfway through listening to my song, I decided I wanted to swap playlist. As I do so,I get another ad? Also, I love having the free skips, but I feel like maybe have 10 skips instead of 6? I also wish I could download one of my playlists, but I dont want to pay for the Spotify Premium every month. Overall, I love Spotify and will keep using it.",

        "review_text":"Spotify has become extremely frustrating to use. It\u2019s supposed to be a music app, but these days I feel like I\u2019m listening to ads more than actual songs. There\u2019s an ad after every single track, and on top of that, songs even get interrupted in the middle just so another ad can play. It completely ruins the experience. Spotify is meant for songs, but right now it feels like an advertisement platform with occasional music. The constant interruptions, excessive ads, and broken flow make it unbeara",

It changed from limiting 30 minutes of listening time to not being able to replay a song or seek back nor even able to listen to more than 1 song from my own playlist. This is peak greediness.

The only thing that is holding me on to Spotify is the music recommendations which by far seems to better than other major streaming platforms. On the other hand it comes nowhere near the sound quality of apple music which provides better quality lossless audio for cheaper prices and also has plans which make sense to buy. Lossless audio is fine but new plans are just horrible and disappointing",

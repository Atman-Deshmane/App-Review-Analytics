## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.swishapp Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 06 Nov 2025 to 05 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The primary driver of negative feedback this period is severe customer concern regarding Food Quality and Safety, accounting for an overwhelming 53% of the total recorded impact score (Impact: 40, Count: 27). Crucially, the company's core value proposition—ultra-fast 10-minute delivery—is paradoxically fueling user skepticism about food preparation standards and safety. Furthermore, critical technical failures, specifically broken ordering filters (e.g., Vegetarian/Non-Vegetarian classification), are actively hindering the user experience and eroding trust.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food Quality & Safety** | **40** | 27 | **Critical Risk.** Customers are explicitly reporting falling ill (stomach aches) after consumption. The speed advantage is backfiring; users believe 10-minute delivery necessitates sacrificing safety and quality, requiring immediate operational transparency. |
| **App Technical Issues** | **18** | 9 | **High Priority Bug.** The specific failure of core ordering filters (e.g., showing non-vegetarian items in the vegetarian feed) is a trust issue that prevents core segments from using the app and generates extreme negative sentiment. This requires an immediate hotfix. |
| **Pricing & Offers** | **5** | 9 | **Trust Erosion.** While low in immediate impact, users perceive promotional features like the "spinner" as rigged or a "scam" for consistently delivering minimal value. This negatively affects customer goodwill and loyalty efforts. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

The following quotes illustrate the severity and key operational challenges identified in the review data:

1.  **Illustrating the Speed/Safety Paradox (Food Quality & Safety):**
    > "I don't think they maintain quality in the food. Whenever I've eaten anything from them, I've fallen sick with a stomach ache. Every item is overly expensive for some reason. They legit deliver the food in 10 minutes or sometimes even before, which is even more concerning." (22 votes)

2.  **Illustrating Core App Failure (App Technical Issues):**
    > "Itni bakwas app me order karne ke liye khola, vegetarian hoon, developer ko filter dhang se lagane nhi aate kya, non veg dikha rahe veg me befkoof app, mood kharab kardiya" (13 votes)

3.  **Illustrating Trust in Promotions (Pricing & Offers):**
    > "Their spinner is basically a scam as it never gives anything other than 10 rupees." (2 votes)

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Launch an immediate, high-visibility Food Safety Assurance campaign.** Conduct an audit of all 10-minute fulfillment centers focusing on ingredient sourcing, handling, and preparation protocols. Proactively communicate how high speed is achieved without compromising food safety (e.g., specialized inventory, not rushed preparation).
2.  **Prioritize Hotfix Deployment for Critical Filters.** Immediately address the technical bug causing incorrect item filtering (specifically V/NV classification). This is a critical trust and hygiene failure that halts conversions for key user segments.
3.  **Improve Financial Transaction Customer Support.** Review and enhance customer service protocols (including weekend coverage) for handling failed payments and pending refunds to prevent financial distress and subsequent one-star reviews when the app fails to confirm an order.

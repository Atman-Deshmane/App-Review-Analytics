2025-11-13 04:58:49,1,"I don't think they maintain quality in the food. Whenever I've eaten anything from them, I've fallen sick with a stomach ache. Every item is overly expensive for some reason. They legit deliver the food in 10 minutes or sometimes even before, which is even more concerning. The coupons and wallet are basically useless, most of the time you can't even apply them.",22,

2025-11-23 08:51:02,5,best quick delivery app. the food comes with proper packaging and the taste is also great and it looks so fresh. i don't know how they are making it possible🙊,6,
2025-11-27 05:10:35,5,"Fresh and tasty food. I have tried zomato, swiggy and bistro. in terms of fresh and tasty food, they have been hit or miss. Especially bistro, their food is never fresh. Swish has clearly surprised me. Keep going guys.",3,
2025-11-16 19:29:03,4,Their spinner is basically a scam as it never gives anything other than 10 rupees.,2,
2025-11-16 11:14:02,1,mention the quantity of each product clearly. There was an aloo made product costing around 130 Rs...and it was a few grams small chips shaped.... worse !,2,
2025-11-13 19:43:53,4,there is no option to pay with upi id on payments page,2,
2025-11-10 10:12:26,3,I payed for my order but they didn't confirm it my money was deducted. they say it will be refunded(according to the faq) but yo where is your coustomer service pls hire someone to chat atleast. you guys take money doesn't place order. it was my first order. edit: spoke with my bank thy said it will be refunded by 2 days it got trenched changing 1 star to 3 star Faq was right then I emailed them but due to weekend no reply I guess but it's alright everything is sort 🙂,2,

2025-11-22 13:56:13,1,"Frauds, pls avoid. Food delivery takes 45 mins. Not Swish (fast). Reached out to customercare after 17 mins to assign a rider & further follow up. Food was stale and reheated. Same gravy used idli or wada or paneer meal. In 45 mins the idli sitting in that gravy becomes slush. Old Peas kachori frm previous day is reheated and sent - hard as stone. Funny resolution ( shady gimmicks from founders)-They will ask to pickup the food for checking. So food is gone and so is the money and no refunds",0,

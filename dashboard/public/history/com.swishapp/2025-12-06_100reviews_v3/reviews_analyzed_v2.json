Same gravy used idli or wada or paneer meal. In 45 mins the idli sitting in that gravy becomes slush. Old Peas kachori frm previous day is reheated and sent - hard as stone. Funny resolution ( shady gimmicks from founders)-They will ask to pickup the food for checking. So food is gone and so is the money and no refunds",

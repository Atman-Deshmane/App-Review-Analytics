## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.swishapp Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 23 Nov 2025 to 05 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The reporting period, which garnered 36 total reviews, saw strong validation of our core product, with "Food Quality & Taste" generating the highest impact (Score 28) and driving overwhelmingly positive sentiment. However, operational issues regarding inventory visibility surfaced prominently, captured under the high-impact "Other" category (Score 13), suggesting widespread friction points related to item availability and stocking. Maintaining momentum requires immediate attention to supply chain syncing to prevent customer drop-off.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Food Quality & Taste** | 28 | 15 | This theme is our primary strength and differentiator. Customers are highly impressed not only with the taste but also the packaging and freshness, indicating excellent quality control from kitchen to door. This narrative should be amplified in upcoming marketing efforts. |
| **2. Other** | 13 | 12 | The high impact and volume here suggest a severe underlying operational issue. Analysis of quotes indicates a prevalent problem: items frequently appear as "out of stock." This negatively impacts conversion rates and frustrates high-intent customers. |
| **3. App & Location Issues** | 4 | 4 | Specific geographical limitations are preventing potential users from accessing the service. The quote regarding "Brookfield" highlights the need to either expand our geo-fenced boundaries or improve communication regarding service area feasibility. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Food Quality & Taste** | "best quick delivery app. the food comes with proper packaging and the taste is also great and it looks so fresh. i don't know how they are making it possible🙏" (7 Votes) |
| **Other** | "evrything is out of stock" (2 Votes) |
| **App & Location Issues** | "Not deliverable in Brookfield 😢" (1 Vote) |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize Inventory Management Audit:** Immediately investigate the cause of frequent "out of stock" issues. A cross-functional review (Operations/Tech) is required to ensure real-time inventory synchronization between the kitchen and the customer-facing app interface.
2.  **Leverage Quality Proof Points:** Provide the Marketing team with the strong positive data and quotes regarding "freshness," "taste," and "packaging" to use as evidence in A/B testing copy and upcoming holiday campaign messaging.
3.  **Review Geo-Fencing and Expansion Strategy:** Analyze service gaps reported in App & Location Issues (e.g., Brookfield). Define a clear timeline for strategic expansion or implement clearer messaging in the app when an area is temporarily or permanently out of range.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Analysis & Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Food Taste & Quality** | **28** | **15** | This is the dominant feedback theme. Unlike typical impact scores which highlight issues, the related quotes indicate high satisfaction. Customers are actively praising food freshness, packaging, and overall taste, solidifying quality control as a high-performing area that drives loyalty. |
| **2** | **Other** | **11** | **10** | This category, led by concerns about stock availability, represents the most significant operational risk identified this period. Reports of "everything out of stock" suggest potential inventory synchronization or fulfillment issues that could severely impact conversion rates and user experience. |
| **3** | **Pricing & Customer Service** | **5** | **5** | This theme remains stable and low-impact. The feedback suggests general satisfaction, with one quote specifically noting "good service." This area does not require immediate, high-level intervention. |

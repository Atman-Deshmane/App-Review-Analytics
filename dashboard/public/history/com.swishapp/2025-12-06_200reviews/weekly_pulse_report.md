## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.swishapp Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 22 Nov 2025 to 05 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
The reporting period saw a strong performance driven by exceptional customer satisfaction with Food Taste & Quality, which generated the highest review volume (17) and impact score (13). This positive momentum confirms successful execution of current quality and packaging standards. However, immediate attention must be directed towards a critical, high-friction technical blocker concerning location detection reported specifically in the Bangalore market, threatening new user adoption.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Review Count | Impact Score | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Food Taste & Quality** | 17 | 13 | This theme is overwhelmingly positive, citing freshness, great taste, and proper packaging. This is a core competency that should be leveraged and advertised heavily, as it is driving high customer engagement and approval. |
| **Other** | 14 | 2 | High volume but low impact. These are typically general positive reviews ("great," "good"). The focus should be on maintaining specific service excellence (Quality, Speed) to convert these general comments into highly impactful, detailed positive feedback. |
| **App Technical Issues** | 2 | 0 | While volume is extremely low, the associated quote identifies a critical, non-functional bug (location permission/manual search failure) in a key metro (Bangalore). **This is a blocking defect** preventing potential users from completing an order and requires immediate L1 escalation. |

| **App Technical Issues** | "App doesn't work. It cannot detect location permission neither can manually search my place. That's not good progress considering when you guys launched, and this is in Bangalore by the way. All the best." |
| **Delivery Speed/Time** | "On time the order was delivered and yummy food." |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize and Resolve Technical Blocker:** Immediately escalate the location permission/manual search bug reported in Bangalore to the Engineering team for emergency patching, as this issue directly halts conversion and access in a critical urban market.
2.  **Amplify Quality Messaging:** Partner with Marketing to leverage the specific customer praise (freshness, proper packaging) in all upcoming promotional materials and ASO descriptions, reinforcing our competitive edge in food quality execution.
3.  **Address Price Perception Proactively:** Initiate a review of current pricing strategy, particularly focusing on the most expensive menu items, and pilot new value-focused combo meals or tiered loyalty discounts to mitigate future high-cost complaints.

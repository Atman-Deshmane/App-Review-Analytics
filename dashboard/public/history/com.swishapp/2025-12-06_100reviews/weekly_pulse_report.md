## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.swishapp Leadership Briefing

**Reporting Period:** 07 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

Review volume remains low (24 total reviews), but feedback is highly concentrated on a single critical operational failure: **Food Taste and Quality**. The severe impact score (38) and associated customer quotes suggest potential health risks (stomach sickness) tied to product consumption, demanding immediate quality control intervention. This critical safety failure is compounded by perceptions of high pricing and dysfunctional discount mechanisms.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food Taste and Quality** | 38 | 16 | **Crisis Point:** Customers are reporting consistent negative health outcomes (sickness, stomach ache) and questioning the safety of food delivered too quickly. This issue transcends convenience metrics and directly attacks brand safety and trust. |
| **App Issues & Support** | 4 | 3 | **First-Order Friction:** Payment deduction issues are creating poor first-time user experiences. The absence of accessible, real-time customer support (chat/phone) forces reliance on slow channels (FAQ/email), escalating frustration during monetary disputes. |
| **Pricing and Discounts** | 2 | 3 | **Trust Erosion:** Customers perceive high product pricing combined with unreliable promotional tools (e.g., the 'spinner') as a cynical attempt to mislead. This lack of perceived value and transparency undercuts attempts to drive conversion through offers. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

**1. Critical Quality & Safety Concern (Food Taste and Quality)**
> "I don't think they maintain quality in the food. Whenever I've eaten anything from them, I've fallen sick with a stomach ache. Every item is overly expensive for some reason. They legit deliver the food in 10 minutes or sometimes even before, which is even more concerning. The coupons and wallet are basically useless, most of the time you can't even apply them." (Votes: 22)

**2. Support Failure During Payment Disputes (App Issues & Support)**
> "I payed for my order but they didn't confirm it my money was deducted. they say it will be refunded(according to the faq) but yo where is your coustomer service pls hire someone to chat atleast. you guys take money doesn't place order. it was my first order. [...] everything is sort 😊" (Votes: 2)

**3. Discount Trust Issue (Pricing and Discounts)**
> "Their spinner is basically a scam as it never gives anything other than 10 rupees." (Votes: 2)

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **URGENT Quality and Safety Audit:** Immediately launch a full-scale review of food preparation processes, storage, and ingredient sourcing across all operating kitchens. Prioritize investigation into the connection between rapid delivery times and reported customer sickness incidents.
2.  **Implement Tier 1 Support Triage:** Deploy a basic, real-time support mechanism (e.g., live chat bot or dedicated payment-support email alias) specifically to handle critical issues like failed payments and money deductions, drastically reducing resolution time for high-friction scenarios.
3.  **Refactor Discount Transparency:** Review and potentially decommission misleading promotional features like the "spinner." Replace these with clear, high-value, and reliable discount codes or offers to rebuild customer trust in pricing and promotional fairness.

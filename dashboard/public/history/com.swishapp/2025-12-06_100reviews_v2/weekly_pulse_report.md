## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.swishapp Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 22 Nov 2025 to 05 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The primary driver of reviews this period remains **Food Taste & Quality**, generating 16 reviews and accounting for 87% of the total recorded positive impact (Score 13). While overall sentiment is strong regarding freshness and delivery speed, a critical and highly detailed negative review regarding stale food, inconsistent preparation, and a breakdown in customer support resolution necessitates an urgent, targeted investigation into kitchen operations and CS protocols.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Review Count | Impact Score | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Food Taste & Quality** | 16 | 13 | High positive sentiment confirms operational excellence in food preparation and packaging is the key differentiator. This quality must be maintained and leveraged in marketing. |
| **2** | **Other** | 14 | 1 | High volume of generic positive comments ("great," "good") indicates baseline user satisfaction is high, likely driven by quick delivery speeds and ease of use. |
| **3** | **App Technical Issues** | 4 | 1 | Though low volume, the associated complaint ("evrything is out of stock") points to a critical failure in inventory synchronization or app display, directly preventing users from placing orders. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Food Taste & Quality** | "best quick delivery app. the food comes with proper packaging and the taste is also great and it looks so fresh. i don't know how they are making it possible🙏" |
| **Fast Delivery & Packaging** | "Best app for food delivery the packaging the quality of food amazing go for it guys" |
| **Pricing & Customer Support** | "Frauds, pls avoid. Food delivery takes 45 mins. Not Swish (fast). Reached out to customercare after 17 mins to assign a rider & further follow up. Food was stale and reheated. Same gravy used idli or wada or paneer meal... Funny resolution (shady gimmicks from founders)-They will ask to pickup the food for checking. So food is gone and so is the money and no refunds" |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **URGENT: Initiate a high-priority investigation into the critical customer service failure and quality complaint** (stale food, ineffective resolution, no refund policy). Review the CS transcript associated with this detailed negative review to identify process gaps and coach agents on appropriate refund and quality assurance procedures.
2.  **Diagnose the "Out of Stock" Technical Error.** Prioritize the investigation into why users are reporting items as universally unavailable, ensuring inventory management APIs and the customer-facing display are synchronized and functioning correctly to maximize order conversion.
3.  **Capitalize on Quality Success.** Coordinate with the Marketing team to amplify the positive feedback regarding "freshness," "taste," and "proper packaging" to further differentiate Swish in the competitive quick delivery space.

## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.swishapp Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 06 Nov 2025 to 05 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
Review data highlights a critical issue centered around "Food Taste and Safety," which registers the highest impact score (35) and includes explicit user reports of illness linked to orders. This severe decline in product quality perception is now intrinsically tied to concerns over our core value proposition—rapid delivery—with users expressing suspicion that speed compromises safety. Immediate, executive-level intervention on food quality assurance is required to mitigate brand damage and user churn.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food Taste and Safety** | 35 | 26 | **CRITICAL RISK.** This is the dominant and most toxic issue. Reports of stomach illness and concerns that rapid delivery (10 minutes or less) implies inadequate preparation are creating a significant trust deficit. The high impact score signals a severe threat to brand reputation. |
| **Other** | 20 | 25 | High user frustration stemming primarily from core application logic, specifically the failure of the vegetarian/non-vegetarian filter. This is a fundamental UX/Data Integrity bug that must be prioritized as it immediately kills the ordering flow for affected users. |
| **Delivery Speed/Area** | 8 | 16 | The low impact score suggests overall satisfaction with delivery speed, with several reviews praising the quickness and packaging. However, this positive trait is now generating negative feedback within the Food Safety theme, creating a paradox we must address (i.e., proving quick *can* be safe). |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote | Strategic Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food Taste and Safety** | "I don't think they maintain quality in the food. Whenever I've eaten anything from them, I've fallen sick with a stomach ache. Every item is overly expensive for some reason. They legit deliver the food in 10 minutes or sometimes even before, which is even more concerning." (22 votes) | Directly links illness reports to the speed of service, eroding the core value proposition. |
| **Other (App Logic)** | "Itni bakwas app me order karne ke liye khola, vegetarian hoon, developer ko filter dhang se lagane nhi aate kya, non veg dikha rahe veg me befkoof app, mood kharab kardiya" (13 votes) | Illustrates the intensity of frustration when basic application filters fail, leading to immediate abandonment of the order. |
| **Pricing and Offers** | "Their spinner is basically a scam as it never gives anything other than 10 rupees." (2 votes) | While low volume, this suggests users perceive promotional mechanics as manipulative, further damaging overall user trust, which is already fragile due to safety concerns. |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Launch Immediate Food Safety Audit:** Initiate a high-priority, cross-functional task force (Operations, Culinary R&D, and QA) to audit all preparation centers, focusing on ingredient quality, cooking temperatures, and safety protocols. We must publicly and internally decouple speed from poor quality perception.
2.  **Fix Critical UX Filtering Bug:** Assign an emergency fix to the Data Integrity Team to resolve the persistent mixing of non-vegetarian and vegetarian items within the app filters, as this issue is actively driving away first-time and frequent users.
3.  **Review Promotional Integrity (Spinner/Coupons):** Analyze the efficacy and perceived honesty of the in-app promotional mechanics (specifically the "spinner"). Adjust the distribution of rewards to ensure a higher percentage of users receive meaningful value, combating the perception of a "scam" and rebuilding customer trust.

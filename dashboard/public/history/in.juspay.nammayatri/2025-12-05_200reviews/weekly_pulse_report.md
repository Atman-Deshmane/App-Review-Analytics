## Weekly App Review Pulse: in.juspay.nammayatri Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 22 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The leading concern this period is the **critical failure of the customer support loop** (Impact Score 3), which is amplifying user frustration arising from persistent and complex technical issues. Customers are reporting discrepancies in fares and distances but find zero ability to resolve these issues through support channels, rapidly eroding trust in the platform's reliability. Urgent stabilization of the support infrastructure and immediate resolution of phantom booking glitches are required to contain negative sentiment.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Lack of Customer Support** | 3 | 6 | This is the highest risk factor. When customers encounter technical errors (like fare calculation disputes), the inability to reach support transforms a functional glitch into a fundamental trust issue. The support void is the primary pain multiplier. |
| **2** | **App Glitches & Errors** | 2 | 5 | Critical backend/UI synchronization failures are occurring. The most damaging error is booking a driver *after* an explicit cancellation, leading to unavoidable and hostile confrontations between drivers and customers, damaging operational efficiency and user experience. |
| **3** | **Driver Behavior & Safety** | 1 | 3 | While most driver feedback remains positive regarding price integrity, new concerns have emerged regarding basic hygiene (body odor/vehicle cleanliness). Furthermore, the serious mention of "Night Safety issue for females" demands immediate operational review of safety protocols and tracking functionality. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote | Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lack of Customer Support & Hidden Fares** | "no support or customer care. app suddenly increased price my recent trip... The driver also confirmed that we did not travel more, but still the app no support from customer care. the app doesn't take the request at all." | 3 |
| **App Glitches & Errors** | "it books me a driver EVEN AFTER I EXPLICITLY CANCEL A REQUEST due to no one accepting a ride, and does not even update the GUI to let me know that a driver is coming. The drivers come and then fight with me for no fault of mine or theirs! This has happened so many times!" | 2 |
| **Driver Behavior & Safety** | "One suggestion to all drivers is to use a body deodarant... The track ride option asks u to download the app even though we already have the app. So sharing the ride details doesn't work. NightSafety issue for females" | 1 |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize Support Stabilization:** Immediately implement a dedicated, high-priority in-app channel for fare and distance dispute resolution with a mandatory 24-hour Service Level Agreement (SLA) for first response, eliminating the "no support" bottleneck.
2.  **Resolve Critical Booking Failures:** Launch an emergency engineering sprint dedicated to auditing the cancellation API, specifically targeting the logic that enables "ghost bookings" after a user cancels, to prevent further driver-customer confrontations.
3.  **Enhance Safety and Training:** Address the newly raised hygiene concerns by incorporating mandatory, frequent training modules on vehicle and personal cleanliness. Concurrently, audit and rectify the functionality of the 'Track Ride' option and urgently review all Night Safety protocols.

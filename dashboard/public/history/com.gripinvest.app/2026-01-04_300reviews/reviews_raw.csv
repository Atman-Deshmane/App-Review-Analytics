2026-01-01 12:27:06,5,"This is one of the best & excellent apps for investing in bonds. People who are saying that they're unable to sell the bonds anytime are either illiterate or simply an idiot. Selling the bonds is one of the risk factors while buying it and it can be sold only when a buyer is available. Just because you want to sell it, it can't be sold at your convenience. So, this is a basic thing an investor needs to understand. Stop blaming the platform for which they're not even responsible.",1,

2025-11-28 05:53:20,1,"They are the worst! My glasses broke in less than one month. The store representative didn't pick up the call. Customer care call didn't connect me to a representative for over 20 minutes and played their irritating music all the while till I got a headache. When you want to order something, they will connect with you in under 2 minutes. When you face any problem with their products, they won't give you the time of the day.",74,
2025-11-28 15:00:10,1,"I visited a Lenskart store in Bengaluru and placed an order for two spectacles along with the Gold membership, totalling over ₹9k. When I checked the order history in the app, I noticed that the salesperson had scanned the wrong QR code for one of the frames. I went back and reported it to the store within two hours after purchase, but there was no option to cancel or update the order. There’s no proper customer support either. First time trying Lenskart, and the experience was disappointing.",68,

2025-11-24 06:02:11,1,"Worst service of lenskart. My experience of visiting the lenskart store was very bad. I ordered the glasses from the store and we picked my order from the store. Firstly there was no home delivery option secondly when I picked my order the glasses box was not there , they gave me a glasses case not a box and not a bill. The printing was removed from the frame of the glasses. I thought the glasses were not new. Worst service.....",9,
2025-11-24 14:48:12,1,"When I bought my new glasses, the lenses were sticking out of the frame. When I tried to get this corrected, the staff just gave excuses. They then charged me a significant extra fee to switch to lenses that would fit the frame properly, despite the fact that I purchased them using my 'buy one, get one' membership scheme.",7,
2025-11-29 06:11:53,1,"I got offer voucher for lenskart in Gpay. So I tried to redeem it, I tried to purchase it and selected gpay as payment gateway, it redirects to gpay app but no payment option to click comes. So I Tried again but then lenkart not accepting the coupon (which hasn't even been redeemed). This is the second time it's happening - 2 different coupon codes... Really frustrating 😡 & disappointing 😔 experience...",5,

2025-12-01 18:20:16,1,"Extremely poor experience with Lenskart. Bought specs with Bluecut Japanese “anti-scratch” lenses and they got full of scratches in just 4 months. Requested a replacement and they kept saying the frame is out of stock, asked me to choose another one, then even that was “out of stock”. After escalation they finally delivered a replacement frame that looked USED. Shockingly bad quality, zero accountability, terrible customer service. Would never recommend.",2,

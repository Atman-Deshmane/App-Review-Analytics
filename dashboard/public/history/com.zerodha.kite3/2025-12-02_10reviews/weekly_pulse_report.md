| **1. App Slowness & Bugs (Options Exit Latency)** | 16 | "whenever I try to exit an options trade, it shows a confirmation signal for at least 10-30 seconds and does not exit the trade instantly. As a result, most of my profits are lost in those seconds, as you know those seconds really matter in options trading. I hope this issue will be resolved soon." | (Votes: 16) |

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Immediate P0 Prioritization for F&O Execution:** Dedicate a specialized strike team to replicate, diagnose, and resolve the 10-30 second execution lag on options trade exits. This delay must be eliminated entirely within the next sprint, as execution speed is non-negotiable for derivatives traders.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis on Confirmation Bottleneck:** Specifically investigate the backend services and front-end confirmation flow, as the user cites the "confirmation signal" as the point of failure. Determine if this latency is due to a recent API deployment, database locking, or a new mandatory confirmation step.
3.  **Proactive High-Frequency User Communication:** Draft a brief communication (in-app notification or email to active F&O traders) acknowledging the reported speed issues, confirming that the technical team is actively deploying fixes, and providing an estimated resolution timeline. Transparency is key to retaining this high-value segment.

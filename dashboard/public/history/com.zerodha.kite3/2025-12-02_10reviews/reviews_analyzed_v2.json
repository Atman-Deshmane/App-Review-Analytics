The main problem is that whenever I try to exit an options trade, it shows a confirmation signal for at least 10-30 seconds and does not exit the trade instantly. As a result, most of my profits are lost in those seconds, as you know those seconds really matter in options trading. I hope this issue will be resolved soon.",

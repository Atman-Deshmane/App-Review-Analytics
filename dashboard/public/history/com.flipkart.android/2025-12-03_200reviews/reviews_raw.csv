2025-11-30 02:31:39,1,"IT'S NOT RESOLVED!! PLEASE OPTIMISE YOU APP. It Hogs all the RAM and freezes and Reloads by itself after a while and I lose my search progress !!! having to start all over again!!. I use flipkart most of the time,more than Amazon and Snapdeal. My device runs both like a breeze on tgise apps, but Flipkart times-out and freezes, and takes longer to Load...sometimes it gets so slow that I just log out midway. 8gb of RAM is more than enough for everything i do,but it can't handle Flipkart, what!!???",956,
2025-11-28 08:12:34,1,Very poor customer service. They impose all kinds of burden on customers only . They don't set the liability of sellers. I purchased two items and repeatedly the seller sent the wrong item. At last I didn't get anything but I paid a platform fee two times it happened. it doesn't matter how much I paid ?? but it's wrong in case you are not taking the responsibility then why are you serving as a mediator between customer and seller?? why don't you register the complaint against the seller??,242,
2025-11-21 06:03:52,5,"I recently bought these glasses from Flipkart, and I am extremely happy with the quality. The frame feels strong and lightweight, making it very comfortable to wear for long hours. The lens clarity is excellent, and it gives a very stylish look too. Packaging was secure, delivery was fast, and the product looks exactly like the pictures. Overall, a great value for money. If you are thinking of buying good-quality glasses at a reasonable price, go for it without any doubt!",236,
2025-11-24 04:32:56,1,"If it's possible to give a negative review, i would have given it as well. First of all, they don't allow you to talk to their customer service executive on call, no matter how much you are pissed off by the service, you just can't contact them. And the delivery issue, they never deliver you on the given date, expect an extra 4 to 5 days delay on every product you order.",236,
2025-11-29 20:01:34,1,"I don’t understand what Flipkart is even doing anymore. I tried buying a 1TB WD hard drive for ₹4750, and the app straight-up refused to deliver it to my address. Not once. Not twice. Five different addresses I tried. Every single one showed “No Delivery Available.” And the best part? I tried again after a few days hoping it was a glitch, and the same nonsense happened all over again. What kind of platform lists products they can’t even deliver? This is ridiculous and a complete waste of time.",222,
2025-11-27 07:28:56,1,"Flipkart has given me a very bad experience again. I received a fraud product—wrong item, poor quality, and even the bill on the parcel was changed. When I requested a return/refund, your team kept telling me to wait for a week. It has now been almost a month, yet no pickup and no refund. This is unacceptable. Please stop selling such fraudulent products and resolve my issue immediately.",197,
2025-11-25 09:10:00,1,"Very bad experience, their customer care executive doesn't help with anything and their application and process is horrible. I cancelled a replacement request and wanted to generate a return request instead of it and it took them 6 days to do so, this is heights when other applications do it immediately. Better order from other platforms who resolve your issues and queries quickly if you face them.",32,
2025-11-19 15:11:56,1,"So I have been using flipkart for many years. And this year I have frustrated with the service of flipkart. All the product delivered are used or duplicate products and the delivery is also delayed. And when you return damaged, defective, wrong color product or any other issue, they will sometimes charge return fees and they will also not return platform fee. They are increasing platform fee on day to day basis. In the October month it was 2 Rs. and now they are charging 7 to 10 Rs. and more.",31,
2025-11-21 11:32:31,1,"Flipkart used to deliver products within 7 days, but now the delivery takes much longer. The app shows 12–14 days, yet the order still gets delayed and often arrives after 18–20 days. This affects the whole shopping experience, especially when we order something for a specific occasion and it doesn’t arrive on time. Even the SuperCoins and offers feel less rewarding now. Please improve the delivery speed and accuracy",23,
2025-11-27 15:05:18,1,"Four points 1. Pressing back button from item page takes user back to the top of the cart page instead of taking user to the last location in the SAVED FOR LATER list. 2. It takes a long to move item from one wishlist to another. End. 3. There is no wish list in grocery items. You can't save any item in a list for later purchase. 4. The ""question & answers"" feature is insane. Moderation is ridiculous. End.",23,
2025-11-30 06:07:40,1,"I've had an extremely frustrating experience with deliveries. As a Flipkart Plus Premium user, I expected better service, but the delivery process has been terrible. Multiple orders were cancelled without explanation, and the delivery executives repeatedly attempt fake deliveries i.e giving missed calls and marking orders as undelivered. It’s absurd that I have to wait 15-20 days for items to arrive.",16,
2025-11-23 14:46:31,1,"My experience with flipkart has been consistently disappointing. A frequent and significant issue is the arbitrary cancellation of orders, often accompanied by a generic message citing 'unforeseen reasons.' Furthermore, the vendor screening process appears inadequate. I have encountered multiple sellers who advertise discounts off an inflated MRP. For refunds, one literally has to beg before them to get the refund initiated.",14,
2025-11-21 17:34:58,1,"Very bad grocery service. After adding any item to the cart they increase the price within few minutes. Those who are purchasing bulk items will never be able to understand when the price of the carry has been increased. It's a big scam. Amazon, big basket etc are kuch better. They don't do this kind of scams.",10,
2025-11-21 13:32:05,1,Very poor substandard service by Flipkart. Sells used and defective products and when one tries to return shows the product doesn't match quality standards. Another notification arrives that we will try to pickup the next day and that day it shows return request has been cancelled and doesn't allow return of that pathetic product. I think only consumer forums can help with these cheaters.,8,
2025-11-22 09:22:31,1,"Never order from flipkart app. I trusted and ordered a product but got the different product from the item, when I replaced that item, the delivery boy said it will be not replaced and I have to message to the help section and the customer care, after I messaged they said it is not possible and the product will not be returned because the time is over, what will I do right now ???? it's totally scammed!!! Now I am fully frustrated, it has happened, I'm saying never trust Fully to the flipkart !",6,
2025-11-24 10:59:06,1,"I’ve been a loyal customer, but the service has degraded significantly. My last 3-4 prepaid orders faced constant delays and false 'delivery attempted' notifications, even though no agent called. Customer care is unreachable, and when connected, the responses are robotic. Extremely frustrated by the lack of resolution and accountability. ​",6,
2025-11-21 08:08:45,2,"Adding a new delivery address in this shopping app is very inconvenient. The app now forces us to locate the address on the map, which becomes a problem when we’re ordering to a friend’s place in a different area. Even when we type the correct address in the map’s search box, it doesn’t show up. The previous method for adding addresses was much better and more user-friendly. Please bring that back.",4,
2025-11-24 03:55:12,1,it's Flipkart no more. this is more like cancelkart. no reasons given .they just cancel the order by saying that the seller doesn't want to deliver here. how about informing the customer at time of placing order. about a month ago I used to place order for fresh veges on the 9 minutes delivery which got delivered but for last few week their page is blank. I got in touch with the customer support and they promised that the issue would be solved but till today it's the same. pathetic .,4,
2025-11-25 07:19:46,1,"I am very disappointed with Flipkart’s delivery service. Every time my order shows “Out for Delivery,” they cancel it with a “Delivery Failed” message without even trying to deliver it. It seems like the delivery person has no intention of actually delivering the package. This has happened multiple times, and it is extremely frustrating. Flipkart needs to fix their delivery system and make sure customers receive their or very bad service from Flipkart 😡😡",4,
2025-11-25 15:31:52,1,"Very poor customer support for flipkart 10 minutes. I had ordered a few items for which a refund was initiated and flipkart shared the refund reference number. it's been 2 months I haven't received my refund. When I checked with the bank, the bank said there was no such refund transaction made and asked to check with the app itself. However, there is no way to raise this as a complaint in Flipkart 10 minutes AI bot customer support. AI bot support keeps on looping with the same questions.",4,
2025-11-25 17:32:43,1,there is a very useless feature added recently that autoplay ad videos in search result that we can't turn off. it consumes my 1.5 gb data in minutes. besides that I can't concentrate on product and can't scroll more time to decide product because of high data consumption in autoplay videos and because of that I can't decide the product and close the app without shopping. very bad experience about it. please fix it asap.,4,
2025-11-19 15:38:38,1,"Ordered 3 products. All three arrived wrong. First product: return was not processed properly, even though customer service said it was done. Second product: return still not done despite repeated requests. Third product: had to take a refund because return process was unreliable. Very disappointed with service. Not trustworthy.",3,
2025-11-21 14:39:24,1,"don't buy anything in expensive products😡😡, because they give us duplicate product, and if you want to return that product they didn't taken that product. They just give you replacement that is same duplicate fake product, I am using Flipkart 6-7 years then they didn't do like now. so my greatful request and advice you please don't buy anything expensive like 1k to etc. 😡😡😡😡",3,
2025-11-21 18:02:59,2,"Grocery orders always have delivery fee, even you are Plus membership and order value above 2K Edit 1: Unable to cancel my order which is NOT delivered as per schedule. Customers should be able to cancel orders if they do not deliver as per schedule. some items list to foolish customer like they strike MRP price and the sell at same price. careful with item price Edit 2: Have platform fees as well. crazy people! do you have any other way to order? edit 1: app crashing when browsing for a while",3,
2025-11-23 09:26:46,1,4 points. 1. Search results keep refreshing automatically. 2. When you open an item from saved for later list the back button takes you to top of saved for later list instead of same location. 3. Managing wish list is very tedious. 4. Same item is expensive in my flipkart account but cheaper in another person's Flipkart account. End,3,
2025-11-29 10:13:20,1,Flipkart must refund whole amount to the customer once it's cancelled. I don't like flipkart's reviewing process either. Our reviews undergo a moderation process. They reject negative reviews for some brands though we use polite language and straight forward language like what is missing or fault in the product we bought with our hard earned money with the sincere desire to help someone to avoid this trap. I think they are getting some bribes from them. I'm tired of this app.,3,
2025-11-19 16:31:39,1,"they have became a thief company.. sending half empty products and not even coming for the return even in returnable products untill the return period gets over.. not receiving any satisfactory response from customer executive.. they all have a fixed cramming answers to all the complaints.. "" THERE IS SOME TECHNICAL ISSUE"" ""WE CAN'T HELP YOU FROM HERE, YOU HAVE TO WRITE TO US"" ""WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU IN 2-3DAYS"" then we don't get any response and even after multiple complaints, we get no resp",2,
2025-11-19 16:57:15,1,"Worst customer service. They never give you the option to talk to a customer care executive. I had ordered a product and the fraud delivery guy called and told me that he had given the product to my security and asked me for the delivery OTP. When I asked him to give the phone to security, then he started blabbering and then informed me that the security is not there with him and told me that he will call later. I wanted to highlight this to flipkart but only chat option is available.",2,
2025-11-19 17:15:38,1,"I'm very dissatisfied with Flipkart Service. when I order a product which was a bit big, they asked me to collect my parcel from the office to which I reply that I'm a bit busy so I cannot go, they said they will bring it tomorrow but they keep delaying the date and canceled the order by themselves. They return the refund amount of the product but they didn't refund the extra charge I paid for handling, eventhough they were the one who didn't delivered my parcel",2,
2025-11-19 20:11:52,1,Nowadays service is too bad. I have ordered 10 days and paid the amount. It was still not delivered yet 3 days back is estimated delivery. I am not getting a proper response from the customer support I have chatted with and had a call with them still they are not aware of what was the issue. still my issue is not resolved,2,
2025-11-20 09:31:47,1,Promised cash back never gets credited. if query is raised resolution is not given and resolution is closed mentioning resolved. customer care executive gives false/ wrong information on call. Also in minutes deliverery wrong/ unordered items are sent. Total waste of money. Also cash on delivery is not available in minutes. If request is raised for anything query is not resolved.,2,
2025-11-20 10:09:23,1,"My experience with this Flipkart order has been an absolute nightmare. The package was marked as ""Out for Delivery"" since yesterday morning, and now, over 24 hours later, it is still not here, forcing me to waste an entire day waiting around for a service that never materialized. To make matters infinitely worse, the support system has completely failed: the assigned delivery agent is not picking up any of my calls, and Customer Care, the lines are completly unreachable.",2,
2025-11-20 13:07:43,1,"Worst app. The delivery guy is rude and also the functioning is worst. They first approved my return and then no delivery boy called me to pick up my product and updated that the quality of the product is not as expected where he has not even seen it. That too they are asking me to file a complain again where they already wasted 6 days in solving this issue and yet not solved and they are just wasting the time so that the product would not be returned. Shame on you, for troubling your customer.",2,
2025-11-20 15:18:19,2,"Getting bad experience from few days, what appears in page does not match with the offer while going for payment. Also the supercoin is not getting used in ordering grocery and now started expiring the same. Although it is clearly mentioned that supercoin is used in every order for 5% of value of order. This seems kind of malafide intention to cheat customer.",2,
2025-11-21 11:19:05,1,"worst experience in online shopping ever. I don't know how this company is still generating revenue to be profitable, if I start a team of 3 people I can make a better functional app. No consideration of the user's experience as well, order gets delayed. If raised a query in customer care, they just say sorry and cancel the order. This company next time should not dare to participate in any Indian college's placement cell, especially in software development category",2,
2025-11-21 13:14:35,1,i would have given 0 if it could have possible but it's the of the worst shopping I have ever seen.. like how i have very old customer of flipkart but they are not really care about customer's issues .. i ordered and paid also but the delivery boy continuously Ignoring my calls and it's showing out of delivery since Morning I said already please delivery on time cz i need to attend .. the customer service also not answering.. and the automatic message support also not answering the queries ...,2,

2025-11-22 17:51:06,1,"The experience is so bad, but can't do anything except just wait for the pickup to be done. It was initiated to pickup by 17th November, I'm writing this on 22nd November and still didn't come to pickup. Daily, it shows on the app that the pickup is today but in the end of the day, it says pickup unsuccessful. Didn't expect this from Flipkart!!!",2,
2025-11-28 09:20:32,1,"Flipkart used to be a reliable e-commerce platform, but now it has turned into one of the worst. The customer support is useless, the delivery and installation process is pathetic, and the products they sell are often low-quality. Every time you try to reach support, they do nothing just copy paste responses without actually helping. When you ask for a refund, they tell you it’s only possible after installation. But when you request installation, they suddenly claim there’s no service available",2,
2025-11-29 05:57:16,1,"Worst app, The staff of flipkart is full of defaulters. If you buy any item from this app, especially grocery, and if you do not receive it and you lodge a complaint, you do not get a refund. Please don't shop with this app, Please don't download this app. ""For your Benefit."" Further your choice. I have told you as much as I could, as much as I could explain, I have told you everything.

2025-11-20 17:15:30,1,"This is by far the worst app I’ve ever used. The products only come with a return option and absolutely no refund policy. Their customer support is completely unhelpful and offers no real assistance. Amazon is far better in comparison. The policies here make no sense and lack any logic whatsoever.

The worst customer support from Artit.",1,
2025-11-21 02:43:59,1,There is no proper tracking on the delivery dates every time it's been delayed for more than a week.. I think it's better to switch to Amazon as we get the products on time at the same price. Very worst experience with Flipkart,1,

I waited 15 days for a mobile cover that was initially expected in 5 days and was even marked as ""Out for Delivery"". After two weeks of waiting, the order was suddenly and unilaterally cancelled.

Their customer service is very poor they didn't understand our problems . One more thing is very bad about Flipkart that It freezes our account, means whenever we book any product apps cancel it automatically and after contacting with customer service they say this is glitch and didn't resolve problem",0,

2025-11-30 07:16:03,1,"worst app ever. you cannot receive your product on time and you cannot return your product. no delivery agent will respond. customer care will attend your call and they will tell you like they will raise a complaint and no one will call you back. application is worst. many time it won't open and give you error message something went wrong. nothing will be updated properly. miscommunication, false promises like I will come today but no one comes to collect your order. A big 0 for Flipkart.",0,
2025-11-30 07:50:26,1,"It’s the worst platform I have ever used. There are so many issues with this app. Their service is terrible — they are never able to complete any delivery on time. Whether it’s express or normal, it always takes weeks. Customer care is also very poor. You’re forced to chat with an AI, and it feels like the AI decides whether it wants to respond to you or not",0,

I used to receive deliveries regularly to the same address before, but suddenly delivery is not available. Kindly fix the delivery service for my location as soon as possible.",0,

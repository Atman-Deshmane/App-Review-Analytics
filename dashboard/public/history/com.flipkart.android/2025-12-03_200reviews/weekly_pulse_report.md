## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing

**Reporting Period:** 19 Nov 2025 to 30 Nov 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Logistics is the Dominant Crisis:** "Delivery Delays & Fails" accounted for 52.6% of the total documented negative community impact (3,896 impact score), confirming that slow or failed fulfillment remains the single largest driver of user dissatisfaction.
*   **Trust Erosion Due to Quality Failures:** A critical breakdown in the trust cycle is evident, driven by "Poor Product Quality" and compounding "Returns & Refund Issues." Users report receiving products that are drastically different from images, leading to highly aggressive feedback and system lockouts (e.g., return options removed).
*   **Customer Care is an Unhelpful Bottleneck:** High-impact quotes reveal that Customer Care is unable to resolve critical technical issues (like clearing ‘Pay Later’ dues) and sometimes actively contributes to user frustration by being "slow, unhelpful, and robotic," amplifying dissatisfaction caused by core product/logistics failures.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Delivery Delays & Fails** | **3896** | "Just the delivery takes more time than other shopping apps. It will be good if you add more more suggestions for accessories. Overall satisfied with the product." | (Votes: 1498) |
| **Other (Deceptive Pricing/System Issues)** | **2498** | "Worst app... if you haven't put your address in that app, they would show the product with very less price. And once you put your address there, the prices will increase drastically..." | (Votes: 707) |
| **Poor Product Quality** | **467** | "The quality of the products I received was absolutely horrible — nothing like the pictures shown... I paid for one thing and got a completely different, cheaper version of it." | (Votes: 445) |
| **Unresponsive Customer Care** | **370** | "Their service and customer support is so poor... I am trying to clear the dues (Rs.156/-) but it always says (please try again later)... They clearly said we can't do anything." | (Votes: 299) |
| **Returns & Refund Issues** | **172** | "I received the saree was very bad in quality and the hot pot set was broken. when I requested for return they kept it in under review even after 48 hours and also they removed the option of call back from my account." | (Votes: 54) |

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Mandate and Fund Logistics Optimization (Addressing Theme 1):** Immediately designate Delivery Delay reduction as P0 for the Operations team. Initiate a project to integrate or optimize last-mile tracking and partner SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to match or beat competitor delivery timelines, mitigating the primary impact driver.
2.  **Resolve System Debt Impacting Financial Trust (Addressing Theme 4 & 2):** Prioritize immediate resolution for critical system bugs that prevent users from managing their financial obligations (e.g., the 'Pay Later' inability to clear dues). This systemic failure is escalating into severe trust issues, legal threats (as quoted), and overwhelming the CC team with unresolvable tickets.
3.  **Fortify Quality Control and Return Transparency (Addressing Theme 3 & 5):** Implement a strict quality gate process (including photo/video proof requirements) for high-impact vendors to tackle Poor Product Quality. Simultaneously, revise the returns flow to ensure that return requests are never manually frozen or have communication options silently disabled, committing to a clear 24-hour SLA for initial return eligibility review.

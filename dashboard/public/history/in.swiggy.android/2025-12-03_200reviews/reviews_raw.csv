2025-11-25 16:42:19,1,"The worst app to order from. Happened with me 3 times now, always thought might be a mistake but this time it was worse. Ordered 2 items from a restaurant, and received none, an empty bag with the cheapest product of the restaurant available. Never happened with any other delivery apps. Also no instant customer support, where should I put up my issue",183,
2025-11-25 01:53:52,1,"Used to love Swiggy but it's getting worse everyday. Got orders delayed by half an our, got cold food delivered, didn't get any compensation. All I got was false promises, twice. Was trying to add a mode of payment and mistakenly placed an order today. Immediately went to cancel the order only to be informed a cancellation fees of the full amount would be charged. it's not even been a minute yet. Frustrating would be understatement.",122,
2025-11-23 09:22:35,1,"While ordering, they promise to deliver in 35mins but it is never within the promised time. I understand, delays might be due to traffic or any other reasons in real-time, but delay upto 30-40mins from the actual time is just ridiculous and unacceptable. Plus they want us to pay more for faster deliveries, yet on that too, they delay the orders. No point of paying extra. Better to prefer other food delivery apps when in cases of emergency.",96,
2025-11-21 10:26:58,1,"I’ve faced delivery delays many times with Swiggy, and most of my orders end up getting canceled. My last order took 1.5 hours just to assign a delivery partner, even though the delivery itself needed only 45 minutes. When I asked to cancel, they said the money couldn’t be refunded. Only after I insisted on either delivering within 30 minutes or refunding did they finally cancel the order. Very disappointing service.",79,
2025-11-30 16:02:53,1,"I am having back to back bad experience with the app where I order some food and few items are missing after delivery. On requesting for help, bot asks few question and then when I choose the option for talk to agent, it will send an auto message which says we will get back to you in 4-6 days via mail since we need more time to investigate. This is so disgusting and frustrating. And when the agen finally comes back( if they comes back) on mail there is no resolution. Complete waste.",52,
2025-11-30 15:05:10,1,"Worst app, takes the order automatically in the name of user friendly interface and also doesn't give any option to cancel the order, with 100% cancellation fee applied to your next order, adding insult to the injury. Going to never place any order from it. Since so many people have given 4 or more stars, that's why they don't bother to resolve the issues of their customers. Bad experience from the customer support, too. They behave so weird",50,
2025-11-20 10:58:44,1,"Pathetic customer support , completely Unprofessional. Delivery partner misbehaved and left without delivering the order , yet the app showed that order has been delivered. After so many mails & calls to the Support team to help me regarding the issue , they didn't even responded to the calls properly. Would recommend everyone to look for better customer friendly platforms.",48,
2025-11-25 17:33:45,1,"If I had a minus option to give, I would gladly do so. It's very rare that I give 1 star to any food organisation but they deserve it. I ordered from Instamart n the food delivery both at different times on the same day. But they couldn't provide any delivery agent on time and it had been too long so I cancelled the order. But they charged the entire amount as cancellation fee. This isn't the first time that such a thing happened. They are a fraudulent organisation.",32,
2025-11-20 04:20:44,1,"I paid extra for an express delievery, so that my order reaches on time. But got delayed a lot. There is no point in adding any extra membership to swiggy, as they do not serve well Late orders on express delievery and even customer care says we will refund the amount. Means no accountability on the paid features of app, but refunds only. Really frustrated here with swiggy now.",22,
2025-11-26 18:21:17,1,"Extremely disappointed with Swiggy Instamart’s pathetic service. This is not the first time my orders were delayed or cancelled. Today, after spending over an hour selecting items, my order was cancelled just because the weight was more. Instead of assigning another delivery agent, you conveniently cancelled it. This unreliability and lack of accountability is unacceptable. Your service is becoming impossible to trust.",11,
2025-11-29 16:35:13,1,"Ordered food, it was getting delayed with no additional notice. Then it got cancelled because the ""restaurant was too stressed"" over an hour after originally placing the order. If you can't make it, you should cancel it early on instead of making us wait, no? And if the customer decides to cancel their order even a minute later they take the whole charge but if the restaurant is canceling randomly they face no extra repurcussions.",9,
2025-11-30 10:20:19,1,I am giving 1 star to just highlight the issue. While ordering on zomato it has 2 coupon sections one from restaurant and other from different banks. While swiggy has only 1 section of coupon in which customer can either apply bank offers or restaurant coupon so i always order from zomato i request swiggy to implement the same feature that will be beneficial for customers. Thanks,8,
2025-11-23 09:22:59,1,Order was placed twice automatically and when I called to cancelled one of the order within a moment after order. they said we will charge the amount equal to order amount which is huge amount for me. There should be some system that should feel burden to make the such penalty. that too penalty for what there technical issue. I don't have such a huge amount to pay neither I call eat so much of food. I had the worst experience. I am deleting Swiggy forever and will never order again from this app,6,
2025-11-29 16:09:09,1,"Honestly if I could give Swiggy zero stars I'd do that instead. I've had the most unsatisfactory experience with Swiggy tonight. This app has intentionally hidden the actual amount of time needed for a delivery and instead kept postponing the delivery time after ordering. I waited more than an hour for my order which didn't even have a delivery partner, which they didn't even let me cancel or get even a half refund. Seeing such scummy tactics employed by Swiggy is very disheartening.",5,
2025-11-22 20:26:51,1,Again had the opportunity to get my order cancelled with a premature reason stating that there is a technical issue. The delivery partner was assigned and reached for pickup and finally a call landed you people should close the business if you can't fullfill the demand. Worst food delivery app. I wish there was a minus review option. worst service,4,
2025-11-28 15:38:29,1,"On it's way to a slow death. Charging customers for convenience but its turning into the most inconvenient service to use. No live chat support, asking customers to email concerns with 5-6 hours for resolution, high fees and charges, customer service executives who offer no resolution to anything. It's ironic an app aim for 10-minute doesn't have 10-minute customer solutions. I used to love swiggy but not I am sick of it. i will be uninstalling the app and cancelling my swiggy card.",3,
2025-11-28 22:44:48,5,"Comparing the two giants Swiggy and Zomato, I find Swiggy's user interface much cleaner and use friendly. The best part is it allows me to order food for my family and friends from Abroad and pay via local bank using upi. No other food delivery app has this functionality. Thank you Swiggy. Keep up the great service.",3,
2025-11-21 11:45:43,1,"worst app, payment screen is automatically debited and it is not asking for confirmation. really worst app I have already emailed on this, asking for a payback of my last order.Even I have cancelled the order within 1 minute of time, but still you people are saying it's as per policy. so as per policy you are stealing money from people. which is really bad.",2,
2025-11-30 14:35:21,1,"Fraud app money got deducted for my order but they are saying the transaction failed and no refund was obtained until now. Also in the app when you are searching food items are already priced above their original prices, same goes for Instamart items even if you have items worth more than 100rs you will still pay delivery+gst+handling charges unlike other apps where you only pay gst+handling. Also there are more than 70rs GST+handling, even if you order delivery more than 150rs for food delivery",2,
2025-11-19 17:54:26,1,"I am extremely disappointed with the service. My order was not delivered to my home, and the delivery status shows ‘address not confirmed’ even though I clearly mentioned the correct address along with the pincode. This caused unnecessary inconvenience and delay. Kindly look into the matter and improve the delivery accuracy.",1,
2025-11-20 09:38:26,1,"APP IS HORRIBLE, CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE EVEN WORSE. the app is so misleading, it will keep showing 5minutes for your order to arrive for 40minutes. The restaurants have no quality checks whatsoever, food sent is filthy stale almost unsafe to be consumed and the customer care doesn't offer any resolution. The chatbox is a sheer time waste, they'll make you go around from one chat to another to a phone call to an email. I don't know how this company is even running till now.",1,
2025-11-20 12:54:00,1,"1/5 Stars: Absolute service and support failure. Shocking 1+ hour delivery delay for an 8 minute distance, timelines are totally misleading. Support is useless, providing generic, copy-pasted bot responses with zero attempt at resolution. Uninstalling immediately. If you value your time and expect basic human interaction from support, look elsewhere. Worst experience, worst customer service.",1,
2025-11-24 06:57:53,1,The experience has gone really bad after AI bots have been put up instead of human customer support. The most rudimentary chatbots have been implemented which do not solve any issue at all. Incorrect and misleading estimates being given. Edit 1: Zero improvement. Stopping usage of the app. Edit 2: Doesn't let me delete the account Edit 3: Dineout doesn't let you use your full cashback balance if you have a reasonably big outstanding amount; the balance expires quickly rendering it unusable,1,
2025-11-24 19:35:21,1,We are been facing delivery delay issues from long time don't won't when is this going to be solved getting hungry ordering food and waiting for 2 hours for our food what is non sense going on in swiggy I use the app almost daily(for both food and grocery) but this is fair to continue with these guys after waiting for this long time we only got the solution to just cancel the order this was my worst experience in this time at 1 pm in the midnight with swiggy it's really becoming worst.,1,
2025-11-25 09:49:18,1,"Scammers looted my money, an item was missing in my order and i have given all the details for refund which was promised to me in 24 hours. after waiting 24 hours, no refund was received and when i raised another query, the customer care agent says the order is 24 hours older so support can't be given. they are clearly scamming customers. they are like scam centers. i would have posted their chat screenshots to expose these scammers but google playstore doesn't have the option.",1,
2025-11-25 19:49:16,1,after being a regular customer of swiggy for years I just got an order cancel from my side by swiggy cause I didn't pay for my meal twice. I paid for my meal ate it and 30 minutes later swiggy operator calls me they didn't receive payment I offered them payment id but they said they want payment or they will cancel my order and they did which is costing me more in my next order in cart. I won't order anymore until this extra charge is removed and swiigy sends me an apology for wasting my time.,1,
2025-11-30 15:32:48,1,"I'm quite disappointed with the high fees on Instamart. I especially don't understand the ""rain fee""—I'm not using water from Swiggy's home to experience rain at mine! These extra charges feel unreasonable and make the overall cost hard to justify. please explain the rain fees, as I don't find it in similar apps.",1,
2025-11-30 16:03:28,1,"Pathetic customer service. THEY SEND WRONG ITEMS. and have zero accountability for it. If the restaurant has delivered a wrong item how can one not be accountable. may be they want people who can eat anything without complaining and have blatant disregard for options. order food cash on delivery check the order and then pay/reject because they do not have ""Customer Service""",1,
2025-11-30 16:45:58,1,"ordered Dominos on Swiggy app at 8.15 pm and even at 10.00 pm they haven't delivered and at the end they canceled the order.. worst app to order food.. they haven't updated on the delay or changing delivery guys.. 1st delivery guy showed up on tracking, but when called he said he is in home. 2nd guy came half way and he backed out of delivery and finally after 1.5 hrs they canceled the order without proper notification. worst performance on Dominos and Swiggy. shame on you guys..",1,
2025-11-22 02:58:10,1,Pathetic event. I ordered a cake before confirmation the delivery time was 20-35 mins. and the after confirmation the time changes to 45 mins. then I cancelled the order within max for 60 to 90 secs for that the cancellation charges is the amount what I paid for the order. how get policy is that why do this platform gives 100 percent refund for late deliveries why it won't that way. it's not about cancellation charges it how much charging for cancellations. The customer service is another lzom,0,
2025-11-22 05:05:02,1,"today I ordered food by applying voucher,stupid app didn't show any messages that the mode of payment applied will not validate the voucher.directly it has gone to upi app.There I noticed it and cancelled the payment.Here is the trick by Swiggy,in Swiggy app it has shown message to continue or cancel,here it has not shown the total amount. when continue clicked,accepted the order without payment, again tricked with full amount. mailed to support team also.",0,
2025-11-22 12:19:12,3,"The food prices displayed on Swiggy are excessively high. For example, Let’s Eat in Edapally, Kochi sells a chicken shawarma for ₹120 in-store. However, on 22-11-2025, the same item was listed on Swiggy for ₹168. After including Swiggy’s additional charges, the total came to ₹254 — an increase of over 111%. Such an exorbitant price difference is unreasonable and unacceptable.",0,
2025-11-22 16:56:44,1,"very bad experience. i placed an order and after waiting for 2 hours, when i called the rider to check the status of the food delivery, he told me the order got cancelled. I was neither informed nor the money got refunded. i contacted the customer care again and a representative took the call and arranged another rider. After waiting for 20 mins, the order got cancelled!",0,
2025-11-22 16:57:11,1,Worst delivery with Swiggy always. They intentionally do a double order and make the delivery very delayed. It takes hours to get the order delivered to the customer. I have placed my order at fasos wrap which is around 3km distance from my place around 9:30 pm now it is 10:24 yet they are saying it will take 20min to deliver the food. This is the 4th time I've faced this issue. I have decided not to order again. Thank you Swiggy for a super faster delivery service.,0,
2025-11-22 19:09:07,1,"I don’t understand how some people get their food on time. This has been the worst service I’ve experienced. If anyone from Swiggy is reading this, please set realistic delivery times. Add 10–15 extra minutes if needed, but don’t let it exceed more than 30 minutes. It’s frustrating when we try contacting the store, delivery partner, and support while waiting endlessly. We keep hoping it’ll arrive any moment, but even after an hour and nearly 2 hour, there’s nothing. Completely unacceptable.",0,
2025-11-22 19:23:42,1,"not a good app. no value for customers & waste of time and money.. it's better if you reach restaurant and enjoy the fresh instead of paying more and have a late dinner/lunch.. the swiggy have no value for time and money and not even realise their mistakes, they will become boss after placing a order just because they got our money, then can do anything in the name of policy.. they will make you waited for 40 minutes, for order which you should deliver in 15 minutes.. don't use this app..",0,
2025-11-23 03:38:21,1,"Worst app ever. I wasn’t able to place even a single order on the train, but the money still got debited and is not refundable for up to a week.

2025-11-23 05:44:12,1,"whenever we want food on time it is getting delayed, it shows 30 mins and later the time increases and get item delivered in 50 mins, delivery partner do double delivery. all false promises. instamart often shows service temporarily unavailable. other apps are much better than swiggy. not recommended",0,
2025-11-23 06:49:29,1,Swiggy has become the worst. The food got delivered after 80 minutes of ordering. It showed 20 mins on the app while ordering it. There is no proper service also for cancelling the order. What is the use of ordering food when you are hungry if it arrives after 80 mins.,0,
2025-11-23 09:29:21,1,"Extremely bad experience. Today I order food my dad who is far from me. Actual estimated time of delivery is 40 minutes. I have waited for 40 minutes still delivery partner not assigned. Then I called customer care spend with them more than 35 minutes in call they assigned a delivery partner. Then also he doesn't pickup my order. Then I called the restaurant, by that time only they are seeing there is an order was there. For everything I have call and arranging. Worst customer care.",0,
2025-11-23 09:40:00,1,"Guys please beware that Swiggy Instamart delivers expired products and cheats in the weight of the fruits and vegetables. I think that it's their business model to silently cheat customers like this ,as people generally do not check for the weights of the products they receive. It's my personal experience. You check the expiry dates of all products and also weigh the groceries delivered by Instamart .",0,
2025-11-23 12:49:19,1,"I recently had a disappointing experience with Swiggy. Their customer service seems to have declined significantly. I received a completely different dish from what I had ordered, and despite sharing photos and all required details, Swiggy simply responded by saying that give poor rating to restaurant, they couldn’t offer any refund or even request the restaurant to send the correct item.

After asking me to upload pictures of the incorrect items, I'm then instructed to email swiggy directly, and I will get a response in 6-8 hours!

After showing a time suppose 30 mins, they can't even deliver it after more than 2 hours. And nobody informs. When you complain they can't take any logical actions.

Ordered twice from different places and never got my food even after paying for it. when i asked for my money back, they never refunded my money.

2025-11-25 21:51:16,1,Horrible delivery experience. Order was delayed by more than 25 minutes. Worst thing was talking to Swiggy customer care. Not taking any responsibility and saying they can't do anything and I should try and speak with delivery partner even though they were not able to connect with him. Please avoid using their service. I've never experienced such bad service,0,
2025-11-26 06:56:42,1,I have order Burger from Burger king. My assign time was 10.15 but the order was very delayed. I have to wait for 2 hours for my order and still they was telling me to wait for more 10mins. I didn't got my order on time. Very bad service. The estimated time was 25-30 mins and all 5 agents told me to wait for 10mins and it went to 2 hours. I have to cancel my order at last and after all of this mess they were compensating me 39 rs. Please do try different app this app is not promising.,0,
2025-11-26 07:39:36,1,"Swiggy's app mechanism relevant to tips is awful and needs work. A single tip from one choice is automatically added to future orders and this is an opt-out feature, not an opt-in feature and the customer doesn't get to choose whether the future tips are added as they wish. It really makes a tip from gratitude and one's own free will seem like an obligation and makes users spend more money without their own awareness.

2025-11-27 17:28:13,1,"Time to leave swiggy. The main problem is a repeated glitch where the app shows “delivery partner is at the restaurant,” but when I call, there is no one there. Then a new delivery guy is assigned on contacting support & when they reach, the restaurant says no order exists. After wasting around 1.5 hours, support asks me to cancel.

Can't they know before that delivery partner is not there so can't take the order at first place. It's your mistake to not deliver order on time then why do you charge customer for 100% fees?",0,

Choose oly cash on delivery, and if they delay the time, do not accept the food,cancel it. For no reason, my 45min order took around 1.5 hours, and since I had already paid, I could not cancel. When I complained that my order was delayed, my delivery partner slowed down even more, and marked the delivery before I got",0,
2025-11-29 04:50:00,1,"I’ve been a regular Swiggy user but this experience has been very disappointing. The app auto-picked the wrong address due to a glitch and after cancelling the order, Swiggy added a cancellation fee equivalent to my entire order amount to every new order I try to place. Support keeps replying with the same copy-paste “policy” message and refuses to acknowledge that the mistake happened because of the app, not me. I’m not even asking for a refund — just to remove a fee that I shouldn’t be charged",0,

Even Dominos don't care about their so called ""30-minutes delivery guarantee"". So, be careful!!!",0,

2025-11-29 18:37:06,1,"5th time disappointed -shows delivery in 2 mins and makes wait for 2 hours, nobody picks calls, finally no food delivered.later delivery agent calls and says he didn't pick the order itself but the app shows so. Life's biggest biggest biggest mistake ever made is placing order on swiggy. Why people still order even after passing such bad reviews and experience. better to stay starving than ordering on swiggy. Worst service without any customer number and even on chat they don't provide solution.",0,

2025-11-30 15:03:55,1,"Few restaurants listed in Swiggy never deliver right order but the main problem is customer service, whenever I encounter any issues with any orders from Zomato, their customer service is quick to resolve my issue. But Swiggy customer service is the worst, they never resolve any issue. I just had a problem with my recent order and these mfs denied to help me. Worst food ordering company.

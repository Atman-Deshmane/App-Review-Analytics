## Weekly App Review Pulse: in.swiggy.android Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 19 Nov 2025 to 30 Nov 2025

### Executive Summary

This period was characterized by heightened customer dissatisfaction dominated by issues resulting in financial loss and operational mistrust. The top pain point, "Missing or Wrong Items" (Impact Score: 237), reveals severe failures in fulfillment leading to customers receiving nothing or incorrect goods. Crucially, these high-impact operational failures are being severely compounded by rigid policies, particularly around "Unfair Cancellation Fees," signaling an urgent need to inject flexibility into immediate transactional resolution flows.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Missing or Wrong Items** | **237** | 10 | **Highest Volatility:** Despite low volume, this theme has the highest impact score, indicating severe customer distress. The strategic concern is the failure of the final mile verification and the perception of fraud (receiving empty bags), which is the fastest way to erode trust. |
| **2** | **Late or Canceled Delivery** | **229** | 35 | **Core Service Erosion:** This is the highest volume issue. The critical insight is the customer frustration with paying a premium for "faster delivery" only to experience significant, unacceptable delays (30-40 minutes late). The paid priority feature is failing its value proposition. |
| **3** | **Unfair Cancellation Fees** | **213** | 12 | **Policy Friction:** This is a policy-driven high-impact issue. Reviews highlight charging full order value for cancellations made *immediately* after placing the order (even within a minute). This technical/policy rigidity is seen as predatory and is directly alienating loyal users. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Customer Quote (Votes) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Missing or Wrong Items** | **"The worst app to order from... Ordered 2 items from a restaurant, and received none, an empty bag with the cheapest product of the restaurant available. Never happened with any other delivery apps. Also no instant customer support, where should I put up my issue"** (Votes: 183) |
| **Unfair Cancellation Fees** | **"Used to love Swiggy but it's getting worse everyday... Was trying to add a mode of payment and mistakenly placed an order today. Immediately went to cancel the order only to be informed a cancellation fees of the full amount would be charged. it's not even been a minute yet. Frustrating would be understatement."** (Votes: 122) |
| **Late or Canceled Delivery** | **"While ordering, they promise to deliver in 35mins but it is never within the promised time... delay upto 30-40mins from the actual time is just ridiculous and unacceptable. Plus they want us to pay more for faster deliveries, yet on that too, they delay the orders. No point of paying extra."** (Votes: 96) |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Introduce a 60-Second Cancellation Grace Period:** Immediately revise the cancellation policy to allow a full, frictionless refund if an order is canceled within 60 seconds of placement, provided the restaurant has not yet confirmed acceptance. This addresses the high-impact "Unfair Cancellation Fees" friction point.
2.  **Mandate Instant Resolution for Missing/Wrong Items:** Implement a dedicated, priority in-app chat flow for customers reporting "Missing or Wrong Items" within 10 minutes of delivery, ensuring human support resolves the issue (refund/reorder) within the first 5 minutes of contact to mitigate severe reputation damage seen in the top-voted quote.
3.  **Audit and Recalibrate "Fast Delivery" Promises:** Conduct an immediate deep-dive into the algorithms determining ETAs for paid "priority/fast" deliveries. If the delivery service fails to meet the guaranteed window (e.g., exceeds 10 minutes past the promised fast ETA), automatically refund the premium delivery fee to restore customer confidence in the service value proposition.

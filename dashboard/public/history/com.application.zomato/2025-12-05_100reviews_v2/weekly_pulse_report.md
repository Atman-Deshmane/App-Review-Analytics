## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.application.zomato Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 21 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The primary friction point this reporting period is a severe failure in Customer Support, which accounts for the highest negative impact score (202), driven by unresponsive service and difficult refund processes. Operationally, concerns regarding delivery grouping persist, with users—including premium 'Gold' members—reporting that order combination leads to delays and spillage, directly degrading the high-value user experience. Total review volume remains low (43), but the concentration of negativity in support channels requires immediate mitigation.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Poor Customer Support** | 202 | 13 | This theme represents a critical failure in post-order issue resolution. The volume and high impact suggest users frequently encounter unresponsiveness or excessive friction in securing deserved refunds, severely damaging long-term trust and retention. |
| **2** | **Delivery Delays & Grouping** | 106 | 7 | The strategic focus must be on protecting the premium experience. The critique explicitly targets combining nearby orders, even for Gold members, indicating that cost-saving operational efficiencies are actively undermining the value proposition of subscription services. |
| **3** | **High Fees & Low Discounts** | 104 | 6 | Price sensitivity remains a substantial driver of dissatisfaction. Although delivery is reliable, users are citing high total costs due to "extra charges." A review of fee transparency and structure, rather than just discount frequency, is warranted. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

Selected quotes demonstrating the severity of current operational issues:

| Theme | Quote | Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Poor Customer Support** | "the actual one time I gave zomato a try, they are literally unresponsive in some cases. and to add, the restaurant had asked me to order something else and still hasn't fulfilled the same. Never using the pathetic app again update: after my review, realized that this is more of a feature that they disable for people who haven't used it for a long time. after trying a couple of times, i was able to get my refund." | 114 |
| **Delivery Delays & Grouping** | "The primary reason for not awarding a five-star rating is the occasional practice of combining nearby orders, even for gold members, which can lead to delays and, at times, spillage. I would be pleased to revise this rating in the future if improvements are made in this area." | 82 |
| **Wrong or Missing Food** | "Almost 4 times my order missed some items. No executive is available even for raising a concern or providing a feedback. Further, the compensations that are provided are not fair and everytime I have to some extra amount just to receive the item which is missing in the previous order." | 18 |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Immediate Support Triage:** Launch an emergency audit of high-impact support flows (Refunds, Missing/Wrong Items). Implement stricter SLAs for initial response time (under 5 minutes for escalated tickets) and automate refund processing for specific, high-frequency failure scenarios to reduce manual intervention friction.
2.  **Gold Member Delivery Policy Review:** Immediately review and potentially restrict the algorithmic grouping of orders for Zomato Gold subscribers to protect the premium delivery experience. If grouping must occur, mandate automatic credit compensation or a guaranteed delivery window.
3.  **Increase Fee Transparency:** Initiate A/B testing on the checkout page to provide clearer line-item explanations for "extra charges" (e.g., separating packaging fees from platform fees) to reduce the user perception that prices are unnecessarily inflated at the final step.

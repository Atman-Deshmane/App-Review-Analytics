## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.application.zomato Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 21 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
Customer Support failures were the single largest driver of negative sentiment in this cycle, registering an Impact Score of 205 and significantly compromising customer trust. While high delivery volume persists, the strategic priority must immediately shift to addressing support channel bottlenecks, which are leading to outright customer abandonment, particularly concerning refund disputes.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Poor Customer Support** | 205 | 9 | The core complaint is unresponsiveness and the difficulty in processing resolutions, particularly refunds. Failure in this area is an acute retention risk, turning minor issues into high-impact customer churn events. |
| 2 | **Delivery Delays & Errors** | 113 | 12 | This theme generated the highest volume of reviews (12). The key operational friction point identified is the practice of combining nearby orders, which customers (including Gold members) report causes delays and quality issues like spillage. |
| 3 | **Pricing and Refunds** | 110 | 9 | Complaints focus on high 'extra charges' creating pricing friction, which is compounded by the poor refund experience documented in Theme 1. Clearer fee structures or bundled pricing may mitigate some of this dissatisfaction. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Votes | Quote |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Poor Customer Support** | 114 | "the actual one time I gave zomato a try, they are literally unresponsive in some cases. and to add, the restaurant had asked me to order something else and still hasn't fulfilled the same. Never using the pathetic app again update: after my review, realized that this is more of a feature that they disable for people who haven't used it for a long time. after trying a couple of times, i was able to get my refund." |
| **Delivery Delays & Errors** | 81 | "The primary reason for not awarding a five-star rating is the occasional practice of combining nearby orders, even for gold members, which can lead to delays and, at times, spillage. I would be pleased to revise this rating in the future if improvements are made in this area." |
| **Order Accuracy/Quality** | 8 | "Ordered food and the restaurant failed to meet the quantity as per the menu, when reported through chat to zomato, it was told to report through email. Got sorry reply only on sending email, no resolution. Customer's loss not a concern, it indicates zomato endorsing restaurants to act at their will..." |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Elevate Customer Support SLAs:** Immediately review and tighten the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for initial support response and refund processing, aiming for in-app resolution within 60 minutes for priority cases to reduce the current high churn risk.
2.  **Optimize Delivery Combining Policy:** Disable the automatic combining of nearby orders for "Gold" members and conduct an A/B test to quantify the negative impact of order combining (delays, spillage) versus the achieved logistical efficiency gains.
3.  **Mandate Resolution for Quality Disputes:** Implement a mandatory, trackable resolution path within the app for reported order quantity/quality issues, eliminating the practice of directing customers to email where resolutions are reported as non-existent.

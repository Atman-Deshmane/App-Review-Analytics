## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.application.zomato Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 21 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

While core product features and app quality remain a high-impact strength for Zomato, customer frustration is heavily concentrating on service breakdowns. "Poor Customer Support" was the most frequent complaint this period, indicating high friction in resolving food quality or order cancellation issues. Strategic attention is required to protect the premium user experience from delivery efficiency measures, specifically addressing combined orders for Gold members.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **App Features and Quality** | 150 | 5 | This theme holds the highest impact, but the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, citing excellent UI, hygiene, and live tracking as key differentiators. This confirms a strong core product experience. |
| **2** | **Delivery Issues & Delays** | 99 | 4 | Feedback is highly specific, criticizing the practice of combining nearby orders, which leads to delays and product damage (spillage). This practice is explicitly eroding the value proposition for Zomato Gold members. |
| **3** | **Poor Customer Support** | 92 | 10 | The highest volume of negative reviews points to systemic flaws in the resolution process. Customers feel chat support is rigid, offers limited options, and forces serious complaints (like food quality) into slow email channels. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote Text | Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Poor Customer Support** | "No resolutions of issues in food quality, quantity. It just says to write a mail. So I guess that's what you charge platform fees for. Chat support is bad, and doesn't give you an option to write your issue many times..." | 40 |
| **Delivery Issues & Delays** | "The primary reason for not awarding a five-star rating is the occasional practice of combining nearby orders, even for gold members, which can lead to delays and, at times, spillage. I would be pleased to revise this rating in the future if improvements are made in this area." | 82 |
| **App Features and Quality** | "I mostly like to order food from Zomato, and overall my experience has been very good. The app is easy to use, and it shows clear restaurant ratings, menus, and offers. I really like the live tracking feature..." | 120 |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Revamp Customer Support Resolution:** Immediately audit and overhaul the support chat flow to ensure that high-severity issues (food quality, quantity errors) allow for free-text input and guarantee escalation to a human agent, reducing reliance on frustrating templated responses or mandatory email redirects.
2.  **Protect Premium Delivery Experience:** Place a hard stop or a clear, prominent opt-out for order stacking/combining specifically for Zomato Gold and high-value customer orders to maintain the speed and quality promised by the loyalty program.
3.  **Enhance Pricing Transparency:** Conduct an urgent UX audit on the checkout flow to eliminate the perception of "sneaky" or "hidden charges," clearly isolating the platform fee and accurately presenting the original item price versus the discounted price, addressing negative sentiment around increasing incremental charges.

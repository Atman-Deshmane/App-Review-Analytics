I really like the live tracking feature, which helps me know exactly when the food is being prepared and when the delivery agent is arriving. The delivery is usually on time, and the agents are polite and professional. The food packaging is clean and hygienic, and most of the time the food remains warm and fresh.",

The primary reason for not awarding a five-star rating is the occasional practice of combining nearby orders, even for gold members, which can lead to delays and, at times, spillage.

Nevertheless, I am currently quite satisfied with this application as a better alternative to Swiggy, and I find it to be truly impressive.",

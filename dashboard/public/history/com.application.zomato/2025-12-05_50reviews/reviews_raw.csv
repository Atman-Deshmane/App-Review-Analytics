2025-11-29 16:52:04,5,"I mostly like to order food from Zomato, and overall my experience has been very good. The app is easy to use, and it shows clear restaurant ratings, menus, and offers. I really like the live tracking feature, which helps me know exactly when the food is being prepared and when the delivery agent is arriving. The delivery is usually on time, and the agents are polite and professional. The food packaging is clean and hygienic, and most of the time the food remains warm and fresh.",120,
2025-11-30 06:56:18,4,"This application generally provides a positive experience for food deliveries. The primary reason for not awarding a five-star rating is the occasional practice of combining nearby orders, even for gold members, which can lead to delays and, at times, spillage. I would be pleased to revise this rating in the future if improvements are made in this area. Nevertheless, I am currently quite satisfied with this application as a better alternative to Swiggy, and I find it to be truly impressive.",82,
2025-11-25 10:16:59,1,"No resolutions of issues in food quality, quantity. It just says to write a mail. So I guess that's what you charge platform fees for. Chat support is bad, and doesn't give you an option to write your issue many times. its just these are your options and go with these. Someone else has cancelled the order, and it shows you a false original price , you will reorder thinking I am saving this much, and will be fooled.",40,
2025-11-23 15:57:37,2,"there's almost never a delivery partner nearby to the restaurants I want to order from. Almost as if zomato wants me to buy from other restaurants where offers happen to exist(promoted). Therefore, I end up not ordering at all. offers or not please let me order from the restaurant I want. if this continues I'll probably go back to ordering directly from the restaurant if it allows delivery or find alternatives. Also, bring back reviews with comments! it helps avoid unhygienic restaurants!",24,
2025-11-23 05:02:48,1,"The recent experiences with this is app ia absolutely disappointing. Almost 4 times my order missed some items. No executive is available even for raising a concern or providing a feedback. Further, the compensations that are provided are not fair and everytime I have to some extra amount just to receive the item which is missing in the previous order. Now, today, after waiting for 45 mins, all of a sudden an executive with very rude approach called me to inform the order is cancelled.",18,
2025-11-23 15:51:57,1,"Ordered food and the restaurant failed to meet the quantity as per the menu, when reported through chat to zomato, it was told to report through email. Got sorry reply only on sending email, no resolution. Customer's loss not a concern, it indicates zomato endorsing restaurants to act at their will, without having consideration for customers. Encouraged restaurants to show more quantity on the menu to attract customers but deliver less quantity. Can zomato justify this?",8,
2025-11-21 22:49:26,1,"I placed an order at 3:07 AM, with an estimated delivery time of 25 minutes. After this period, the delivery rider remained at the restaurant. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to contact the rider via calls or messages. Subsequently, I contacted the restaurant, but the provided number was unresponsive. Upon reaching out to support, I was informed of an additional 40-minute delay due to the rider managing multiple orders. The support representative suggested consuming the dosa, which is",7,
2025-11-22 05:12:51,1,"I am extremely disappointed with the level of service I received. I placed an order for specific food items, yet an entirely different order was delivered to me. The hotel clearly confirmed that the incorrect order was not from them, which raises a serious concern about how your delivery personnel managed to hand over the wrong items in the first place. I submitted a complaint with all the necessary details and evidence, but Zomato’s customer support has been utterly unresponsive. Not a single",7,
2025-11-25 10:00:48,1,"Extremely disappointed with Zomato’s recent orders. Two items were missing, and even after sharing the photos they requested, they simply said they “couldn’t verify” the issue. I asked for proof of an RCA showing the items were actually packed, but received no response. Instead of resolving the issue or even bothering to check properly, they just closed the case without any justification Very poor customer support.",7,
2025-11-25 16:39:43,1,"I placed an order while travelling in a special train, and Zomato did not provide proper delivery tracking because the location was not supported. I cancelled the order within 3 minutes because the assigned vendor (Hotel KFC) was not responding to any calls, and I had no way to confirm preparation or delivery. Despite cancelling immediately, Zomato did not process my refund. This is unfair as the service was not provided and the vendor was unreachable. Please issue a full refund at the earliest.",7,
2025-12-01 03:28:16,3,"It's OK. Poor service levels vs last time. Mainly from app perspective. They have become very sneaky - hidden charges, the platform fee keeps increasing by 50p every couple of weeks, they no longer call out delays - still says arriving on time when a 25 min order comes in 35 minutes. I miss the old Zomato. Now it's all faff and not enough good quality service.",7,
2025-11-22 09:54:14,2,I usually have a good experience with the app however I face this issue on and off that the delivery agent goes missing with my food. The only way Zomato has been able to help me at those times is by refunding my money. I guess that is the limit till where their accountability ends. The customer is however left with two options there - 1. order again and wait for another 30-40 mins while being absolutely irritated. 2. not order anything and just make the damn food by themselves.No accountability,6,
2025-11-22 18:00:38,1,"WORST CUSTOMER SUPORT. WORST APP. doesn't deliver package on time and most of the time package is damaged and items gets spilled and destroyed, packages torn.DON'T ORDER FROM THIS APP. If you face a problem with order, without solving it right away they ask users to write email to customer support and it takes 3-4 days for them to reply. despite attaching HD video proof and HD images their retard team doesn't help the customer. worst customer support services ever experienced.",5,
2025-11-24 05:01:39,2,"Zomato’s delivery service has become ridiculous. Orders are delayed again and again, and unless I waste my time following up, the food just shows up whenever — usually late. And when I finally ask to cancel after waiting an hour, they pressure me to accept cold, soggy food like it’s my problem. The service quality has dropped drastically, and customers are the ones paying for their incompetence.",4,
2025-11-25 08:46:30,3,Changing my review from 5 stars earlier to 3 becoz they've removed the individual food items rating system. Now it just says 'Highly Ordered' for me that doesn't mean necessarily that the food item from a new restaurant is good. I need to know the exact rating like it was earlier so I can confidently try new restaurants and new dishes based on that,4,
2025-12-01 17:32:53,1,"Stupid app. Why list products on the app when they are unavailable? You cancel the order only after the delivery person has reached the restaurant, wasting an hour of time. Do not have the decency of cancelling it before and saving time and money. Happened more than once now. Unacceptable.",2,
2025-11-28 11:17:40,3,"it's good but there is one loop hole and that's really annoying, that we can't order from multiple places in one order like zomato does not have a cart like facility like other E shopping platform now if we have to order from multiple places we have to order as many places we are going for, not a single order is being executed",0,
2025-11-29 23:34:05,1,"After 30 min of ordering, the order was cancelled by the restaurant stating some items were out of stock and the refund was also not on time If you're ordering i suggest you pay after delivery because if the order gets cancelled it takes 3+ days to reach your bank. When paying they take it on the spot but for refund why you take so long to give back our money.",0,
2025-11-30 05:44:38,1,"Highly disappointed that Zomato is giving offers unfairly. I order food almost daily via zomato. But, I noticed that I am not getting the much offer, while my room mate (who dont order often) getting many offers like 125 off etc almost daily, which shows there is no discount or offer for regular users. This demotivates me to use Zomato further. pls improve.",0,
2025-11-30 09:08:21,1,"My experience with Zomato has become disappointing I’ve been using the app for over a year but recently most of my orders were either delayed or never delivered at all. When I tried to cancel the customer care told me that if I cancel my COD option would be disabled for future orders. Because of that, I was forced to wait instead of getting help Customer support also didn’t solve any of my issues despite multiple attempts. Overall the service has become unreliable and frustrating. I am done now",0,
2025-12-01 16:09:33,1,Zomato is the worst food app in the country when it comes to customer service. Mistakes are often made when items are incorrectly delivered or of horrendous quality. There is just no way to reach customer service. You have to mail them and will almost never hear back. Any responses if at all would be template type responses with zero attempts to resolve customer complaints. Zomato sucks - you are better off switching to another platform,0,

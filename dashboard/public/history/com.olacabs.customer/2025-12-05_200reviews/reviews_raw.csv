2025-11-25 09:46:19,1,"Ola is becoming the worst app ever for cabs. Always facing issue during online payment via credit card. After journey started, they provide us only 15-20 mins to pay via card and it's not even work. Even though your ride is about 2 hrs longer, but after 30 min their message started popping up like 'you cannot pay online because your ride is about to end, you have to pay in cash'. Always facing server down issues during online payment, i always have to pay in cash. Worst worat app.",45,
2025-11-23 15:07:46,1,"Very disappointed with this ride. When I booked, the fare shown was ₹1235 and there was absolutely no mention anywhere that extra toll charges would be added later. Suddenly the final bill became ₹1782 with toll and other charges. This is completely misleading and unfair. Apps like Rapido clearly show the full amount and charge exactly what is displayed, including tolls. Terrible and frustrating experience — will think twice before using this service again.",19,
2025-11-22 03:18:28,1,As pathetic as any app could be..... It has happened with me for straight two times that I've booked a cab for a location and the app automatically changes my location. You have to then negotiate with the driver at a higher price to drop off at the required location. Suggest OLA to hire some good engineers and fix this bug. For me it's done.. Never going back to OLA again also when the competitors provide much better service and better price. Do not use this app ever,11,
2025-11-26 13:01:38,1,the ride price after booking and after the ride is completed is never the same. also on trying to rise payment issue it always says there is no change in the ride price. also for additional support it asks to send mail.. why bother with any help in the app if you are handling via mail. only additional unnecessary work and waste of our time. There are much better ride apps with far better in-app service than this.,3,
2025-11-22 15:47:30,1,"I had a very bad experience with Ola recently. We booked an auto,and somehow the location changed after about 10 minutes into the ride. When we asked the driver why we were heading in the wrong direction, he said, We can go this way also. But in the end, he dropped us 3–4 km away in the opposite direction. The fare was ₹252 just for those 3–4 km. Moreover, we couldn’t raise a proper complaint in the app.Whenever we try to report the issue, the only response we receive is Thanks for feedback",1,
2025-11-28 04:38:08,1,"there is no customer care support , only a few predefined information. Now a days not allowing to pay directly from credit card, always showing payment failed, and it is allowing only ola money, and while clearing ola moneay due they are charging extra fee, for collecting extra charges they are not allowing to pay directly. when we book a later scheduled ride, the maximum it is canceled after reaching ride time. Actually, it should book another ride. charges also varying person to person.",1,
2025-11-30 10:44:28,1,Worst Booking experience. Third Class drivers appointed for accepting Booking. I missed my flight due to ola booking done on dated 30.11.2025. Driver accepted my booking for Mumbai Airport from Navi Mumbai after acceptance driver was 6 mins away from pickup location but to my surprise driver instead of coming to location he went away from pickup location. I called him 3-4 times but neither picked up my calls nor cancelled trip so that I can able to book another trip. I missed my flight,1,
2025-11-21 15:47:47,1,"The bill amount was ₹285 which I got to know later. The driver stopped the car, saying he needed to refill CNG and would not continue the ride. I told him it wasn’t my fault and that he shouldn’t have accepted the ride if he couldn’t complete it. He then took the estimated amount shown on the app, ₹486, instead of the actual bill amount of ₹287. I reached out to help section and they refused to help or refund my money. I sent email to grievance attaching the UPI screenshot and CRN details",0,
2025-11-21 17:51:27,1,"I am facing an issue with my Ola account linked to my phone number. It appears that the number was previously associated with someone else, and a cancellation fee of ₹125—incurred by the previous user—has been added to my account. This charge is not mine, yet it is still showing as payable. I also tried to delete or deactivate the account associated with my number but was unable to do so. Please help resolve this issue by removing the incorrect cancellation fee and ensuring my number i",0,
2025-11-22 03:07:27,2,"Unable to pay the postpaid amount through app... not able to see ""Clear Dues"" option. App team please check this issue. I should not get charged any penalty for late payment. I am ready to pay my invoice...",0,
2025-11-22 11:33:08,1,"Super fraudster company, the driver charged me the parking fee additionally and the same was already included in the bill, when I highlighted the issue over the email to Ola, they assured me of a refund and asked me for my UPI id. I have given all the details and have been following up on the same email for the last two months but neither I received any reply nor my refund. No wonder the company is making a loss and the share value is also decreasing.",0,
2025-11-22 16:17:57,1,They fool the customers by adding insurance charges of Rs. 11( 8+3) per trip towards insurance and health packs. You will never find such charges while booking. Always check the invoice. Also you won't get a ride unless you add the tips. They have recently added this feature. I am deleting the App.,0,
2025-11-22 17:09:32,2,price is reasonably higher than other applications and wait time is also high and also drivers demand extra cash for the ride . For instance I had booked ride and distance was 25 km away driver reached the pickup location fare was showing 254 but driver asked for 300 and denied for ride ...,0,
2025-11-22 23:59:00,1,"I was using OLA for the past 2 years. However, recently the entire booking system has become a total harassment. The cab drivers no longer accept the rides unless we add 100 200 rs extra just for 4 kms. In state of emergency this is a waste of time and money. There is no use of having cab booking app if the system is just the same as doing a rickshaw pooling.",0,
2025-11-23 08:26:39,1,"Very bad experience, for the last few months whenever I booked a ride, it was always like looking for a driver, then cancel, this happened not once but many times, now I did not get a ride instead of this, that is a different matter but I was late for it. Your job was to identify me at the right time and in the right place, but you guys aren't doing your job properly. And what was your purpos now? Because it can't even book rides. And not only me, people around me have also experienced this.",0,
2025-11-23 09:57:09,1,"I’m beyond done with Ola. The constant demand for extra money from drivers has turned every ride into a headache. The fare shown in the app means absolutely nothing because drivers keep pushing for more the moment they arrive. It feels like the system is completely out of control. The whole experience is chaotic, unprofessional, and honestly exhausting. I shouldn’t have to argue or negotiate every single time I book a simple ride. Ola needs to wake up, take responsibility, and put an end to this",0,

2025-11-23 15:05:09,1,"very disappointed service, never use this aap, better to use some other app like uber or rapido, I called for a cab within 3 km & it was showing 150-250 & after the ride they charged me 534 & I'm trying to contact there customer support but there was no option showing in there aap, & got very rud driver was got very upset with this.",0,
2025-11-24 11:29:21,1,"Extremely disappointed with Ola’s support. There’s no real customer service; issues never get resolved. The in-app chat only gives automated replies. They even respond to Play Store reviews asking us to message them on Facebook, but nothing gets fixed there either. It feels like they just redirect customers without solutions. I’m uninstalling this app; Ola doesn’t seem serious about customers anymore. Choose better alternatives.",0,
2025-11-24 12:26:57,1,"This application is the least favorable compared to other ride-sharing apps. Ola tends to impose higher charges and employs unprofessional drivers. There is a lack of a competent team. It is advisable to consider alternative applications. Drivers frequently demand additional fees beyond the displayed amount, and on occasion, they may consume alcohol, drop passengers in questionable locations, and provide inadequate safety for women. I have lodged complaints multiple times, but of no use.",0,
2025-11-25 12:13:18,1,"When I am planning to go delhi (approx 25 km away ) , i booked ola and drivers keep changing. it become so late ,we were waiting for ola since 1 hour it did not came . so unfortunately I booked rapido and it came in only 5 minutes. so I think we should not book from this app, i trust this app but it broke it .",0,
2025-11-27 00:57:00,1,Adding cancellation charges while the driver is not responding. The support chat doesn't give option to express our side or chat with a representative. Asks us to send email and there also only automated response. No way to call and talk to customer care. Adding the CRN : 17068165. PS i do not have twitter or Facebook ids.,0,
2025-11-28 06:51:04,1,"In a recent ride booking, despite of constantly telling him, my driver did not stop the ride from his Ola app and told me to pay the estimated price saying that his app was not functioning properly.I waited for 5 minutes but he did not show me the actual price so I had no choice but to pay the estimated amount of ₹461. But just after he left I checked my phone again and the actual price was ₹409.I frequently book Ola rides and this is the second time that this happened.Please look into the issue",0,
2025-11-28 13:32:42,1,"Driver taken extra money claiming required for toll. Driver demanded extra money after sharing OTP. He was very aggressive in nature. As drive started vehicle & looking to his aggressive behavior in night time, no option than giving extra 130 rupees offline. When tried to complain to Ola, they are simply shown inability to help. Poor app. Will recommend to shift to other apps like Uber & Rapido.",0,
2025-11-29 03:12:15,1,"Ola has become a scam app, always when I book drivers taking more time to accept even they accept don't respond at times, even they respond ask for extra money always that too 100 to 200 rs more than what is showing... drivers complaining their money is looted by ola as commission. recently I won't see any proper response from drivers while booking. I was a regular user but from last 2 months I stopped using the app itself... ola need to rethink their buisness",0,
2025-11-29 05:26:49,2,"credit card payment doesn't work They have started deleting ride records older than 30 days. This all is very inconvenient. Team I shared my problem and still waiting for a positive response, on the other hand Rapido gave me all the bills in single email within 10 mins",0,
2025-11-29 13:19:25,3,drivers are running by meter and charging extra money other than shown in your app and doing arguments for not giving extra charges. either you guys give the exact amount on the app or stop showing any fixed charges also coordinate with auto drivers. I've experienced twice in a month. so take this point in consideration.,0,
2025-11-30 17:33:34,1,Ola the stupidest cab booking app ever. They want all cab users to sign up for their scooter or other stupid products. They have conveniently deleted the user history feature and I am unable to retrieve cab bills which are just a week old. Write to them and they just assign a ticket and that's the end of it. Never book on this app,0,
2025-12-01 05:40:30,1,"There is no customer care number to call, if you have any problem during the ride. And now a days new froud is trending that on ola app fare is showing one and driver is forcing to go as per meter fare. Be alert. I have faced this issue today ola fare was rs 390 and driver is saying it's rs 730 as per meter, you must have to pay 730. I tried to get help from the app, but couldn't find the correct FAQ.",0,

## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.olacabs.customer Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 21 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The primary risk this period stems from critical App & Payment Issues, which generated the highest impact score (56) despite a low review count. User feedback details chronic failures of online payment gateways, forcing unexpected cash payments even on long rides, compounded by strict 15-minute payment window limits. A secondary, but highly visible concern is the lack of transparency regarding toll and extra charges, which is leading to large discrepancies between quoted and final fares, damaging customer trust.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **App & Payment Issues** | **56** | 5 | **Critical Stability Failure:** The severity of the payment issues (server down, short payment window expiration) suggests a systemic failure within the payment orchestration layer. This forces inconvenient cash transactions and severely degrades the core digital experience, verified by a quote receiving 45 votes. |
| **2** | **Hidden Charges & Pricing** | **23** | 8 | **Transparency Gap:** Reviews highlight misleading fare quotes, particularly the omission of toll charges, resulting in final bills far exceeding expectations. The direct comparison to competitors who display all-inclusive fares indicates a strategic disadvantage regarding pricing clarity. |
| **3** | **Driver Behavior & Demands** | 2 | 11 | **Volume vs. Impact:** This theme generated the highest volume of reviews (11) but a low impact score. The core operational insight is the continued failure to adhere to routes and the subsequent failure of the in-app complaint system to offer meaningful redress beyond canned responses. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

The following quotes illustrate the most severe pain points experienced by customers during this reporting period:

| Theme | Quote | Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **App & Payment Issues** | "Ola is becoming the worst app ever for cabs. Always facing issue during online payment via credit card. After journey started, they provide us only 15-20 mins to pay via card and it's not even work. Even though your ride is about 2 hrs longer, but after 30 min their message started popping up like 'you cannot pay online because your ride is about to end, you have to pay in cash'. Always facing server down issues during online payment, i always have to pay in cash. Worst worat app." | **45** |
| **Hidden Charges & Pricing** | "Very disappointed with this ride. When I booked, the fare shown was ₹1235 and there was absolutely no mention anywhere that extra toll charges would be added later. Suddenly the final bill became ₹1782 with toll and other charges. This is completely misleading and unfair. Apps like Rapido clearly show the full amount and charge exactly what is displayed, including tolls. Terrible and frustrating experience — will think twice before using this service again." | **19** |
| **Poor Customer Support** | "Super fraudster company, the driver charged me the parking fee additionally and the same was already included in the bill, when I highlighted the issue over the email to Ola, they assured me of a refund and asked me for my UPI id. I have given all the details and have been following up on the same email for the last two months but neither I received any reply nor my refund." | **0** |

### 3. Recommended Actions

Based on the high-impact themes and critical customer feedback, the following actions are recommended immediately:

1.  **Emergency Payment Stability Audit:** Prioritize a deep technical review of the online payment gateway stability (server down issues) and immediately remove or extend the arbitrary 15–20 minute payment window that fails long-duration rides.
2.  **Mandate Fare Transparency:** Update the booking flow UI to explicitly display a line item for estimated/guaranteed tolls, taxes, and other surcharges before the final booking confirmation to match competitor transparency standards.
3.  **Streamline Refund Escalation:** Conduct an immediate audit of the Customer Support refund process, specifically targeting cases involving long delays (e.g., 2-month delay cited), to ensure prompt resolution and restore trust in the complaint system.

## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.ubercab Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 27 Nov 2025 to 30 Nov 2025

### Executive Summary

Despite a low volume of total reviews (3), the feedback highlights critical failures in transparency and usability, representing immediate operational risk. The highest impact theme this week (Score 79) centers on the UI/UX flaw that prevents riders from verifying or seeing the final drop-off location after booking but before the trip starts, leading to incorrect destinations. Coupled with persistent complaints about unreliable pricing and alleged misleading promotional offers, the core issue remains customer trust and transparency.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Usability & Experience (UI/UX)** | 79 | The inability to view or re-verify the destination address on the active booking screen (prior to pickup) is a critical safety and accuracy failure. This indicates a gap in the ride verification flow, directly causing riders to take incorrect trips. |
| 2 | **Performance & Reliability** | 31 | This theme is characterized by two operational weaknesses: persistent inaccuracies in location pickup services and frustration over "unreliable pricing" (surge transparency) which customers perceive as predatory rather than justified by volume. |
| 3 | **Other (Pricing/Offers)** | 13 | The lowest volume complaint is arguably the most damaging: allegations that discount promotions (specifically naming Uber One) are misleading and result in a *higher* final fare being charged, leading to accusations of opportunistic business practices. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote Text | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Usability & Experience (UI/UX)** | "This is a very important feature that seems to be missing. While booking a ride, the app should always clearly show the drop-off location. Today, I booked a ride and wanted to recheck the drop-off name, but the ride arrived before I could verify it. After the trip, I realized that the location was incorrect..." | 79 |
| **Performance & Reliability** | "I also like that we can rate drivers easily. However, I don't appreciate their unreliable pricing! It's really not good business to raise prices, even during busier periods when extra volume = more money earned!! Please stop, it's not good business! Also, location pickup is really off lately!" | 31 |
| **Other (Pricing/Offers)** | "They are very opportunist business men... I was getting a fare of 375 for a place... The app offered 10% discount by joining uber 1. i clicked and 268 got deducted and my new fair was 395... Don't subscribe to any of the offers by uber they are totally misleading and will just take money out of you." | 13 |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Mandate Drop-Off Verification Visibility (UI/UX Focus):** Immediately update the active booking screen (after acceptance, pre-pickup) to permanently display the confirmed drop-off name and address, allowing riders to verify the destination easily until the trip physically begins.
2.  **Audit Promotional Transparency (Uber One):** Initiate an urgent investigation into the specific mechanics of promotional discounts (e.g., Uber One trial fares) to ensure that the quoted price *after* the discount is unequivocally lower than the original price, eliminating any possibility of misleading customers into higher-cost rides.
3.  **Improve Geolocation Accuracy:** Prioritize the recalibration and optimization of geolocation services to reduce customer friction caused by inaccurate pickup points, addressing the repeated performance failure cited in reviews.

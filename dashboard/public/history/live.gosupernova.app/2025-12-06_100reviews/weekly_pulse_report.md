## Weekly App Review Pulse: live.gosupernova.app Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 22 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The core value proposition—AI Practice & Feedback—remains overwhelmingly positive, driving the vast majority of positive impact this period (Impact Score 365). However, a critical alert has surfaced regarding pricing transparency; a single, highly-voted review (Impact Score 26) criticized the immediate paywall after sign-up, demanding immediate attention to the user onboarding flow to maintain user trust.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **AI Practice & Feedback** | 365 | 10 | The AI engine is delivering exceptional value, particularly for spoken English learners in India, validating the core product investment. The positive feedback is detailed and highly promotional, reinforcing Supernova as a “solid-to-very-good” tool. |
| **2** | **Hidden Fees & Pricing** | 26 | 1 | This is a high-impact risk item. Despite the low volume (1 review), the user explicitly feels misled by marketing and the immediate requirement for payment upon login, severely damaging trust at the critical conversion point. This requires immediate review of marketing messaging and the onboarding funnel. |
| **3** | **Confidence & Fluency Boost** | 19 | 8 | This theme validates the crucial *outcome* of the AI practice. Users highlight the AI's ability to correct mistakes without the embarrassment associated with human interaction, leading directly to higher confidence and motivation. This emotional benefit should be amplified in marketing. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

We selected three quotes that best illustrate the core value and primary risks identified this period:

| Theme | Quote (Votes) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AI Value Validation** | "Supernova AI is a very good choice for many English-learners in India, especially for spoken English... I'd recommend you treat it as a tool use it regularly (daily or near-daily), actively speak/practise, and try to apply what you learn (in real conversations, with friends, or at work)." (120 Votes) |
| **Pricing & Trust Alert** | "Very, very disappointed with this app! I downloaded it because the name and ads made it look like a simple spoken English learning app, but the moment I logged in... it asked a few details and then immediately showed a screen asking for ₹9 for just 3 days of 'premium.'... If the main spoken English lessons are paid, at least be honest about it in the ads." (26 Votes) |
| **Confidence & Differentiation** | "It's like having a personal teacher, correcting mistakes and building confidence... This is the best one to practice english speaking, we are corrected by AI, so no need to embarrass ourselves, now I'm getting confident in taking my session in english." (7 Votes) |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Immediate Onboarding Funnel Review:** Audit all advertising copy and the initial sign-up flow to ensure transparency regarding the premium status of core lessons. The goal is to eliminate the perception that the user is being "trapped" by an immediate paywall after entering personal information.
2.  **Amplify the "No Embarrassment" Hook:** Update marketing creative and landing pages to heavily feature the user benefit of practicing without embarrassment ("corrected by AI, so no need to embarrass ourselves"), as this is a powerful psychological barrier the product successfully removes.
3.  **Address Critical Connection Bug:** Immediately investigate and resolve the reported "Failed to connect. Showing old data" bug, as this directly affects user retention and has resulted in an explicit demand for a refund due to service disruption.

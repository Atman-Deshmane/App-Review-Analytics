But in here, there's just enuff exercises to make you fluent at the same time being not boring. I've been addicted to learning German which I thought I would never say. All you need is 20 min everyday, and the energy system is good as well, if you want to practice more than 20 min, you watch a single short ad. Would recommend.",765,

The app makes language learning engaging and fun, with bite-sized lessons that fit perfectly into my schedule. It's not just about Japanese; Duolingo also offers a variety of languages and even includes subjects like chess, mathematics, and basic economics. It’s a fantastic platform for anyone wanting to pick up new skills. Happy learning!",95,

Second: some courses have weird priorities, as an example: Wizard (Valho) was one of the first words I learned in the Finish course.",93,
2025-11-25 11:11:26,3,"EDIT: Removing 2 stars from my previous review. The app used to have hearts that remained as long as you got everything correct, now it's got this stupid energy system that runs out regardless of how much you get right. That's not rewarding, it's frustrating. You know what else is frustrating? When I say EXACTLY what the app wants me to say it fails to hear me correctly and I get the answer wrong. Why do I only get 3 attempts? I should be able to speak until I get it right on speaking exercises.",21,
2025-11-30 07:11:59,4,I really loved it but the problem is that it was more fun when there was no subscription option . now its more likely to depend on subscription which make it kind of boring and difficult for those who cant pay..I used to use it as a hobby but just because of subscription and full of ads it has become limited and the next day or moment we might forget it,16,
2025-11-30 05:40:40,2,The icons and the characters of the app are not showing on my smartphone. I have tried uninstalling and installing it again but it doesn't help. Everything works fine on my tablet though although it is a little inconvenient because of the landscape orientation. I hope this gets rectified soon. It is so much more convenient on my smartphone instead of a tablet.,13,
2025-11-26 19:59:22,2,"It helps to learn vocabulary but doesn't explain anything about grammar or sentence structure which is super important if you're trying to learn/speak a new language. also, the number of ads is just ruining the experience. I get it that I'm using the free version, but that's too many ads for the amount of learning time allowed daily.",11,

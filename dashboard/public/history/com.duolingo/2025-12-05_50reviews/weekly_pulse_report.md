## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.duolingo Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 22 Nov 2025 to 01 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
The core value proposition of Duolingo—making language learning fun, effective, and addictive—remains exceptionally strong, generating an overwhelming majority of positive impact (Score 1044). Strategic friction points primarily revolve around product mechanics changes, specifically high user frustration with the perceived lack of rewarding design in the current 'energy system' replacing the classic 'hearts.' Additionally, users expressed concern that increased ad frequency and paywall dependency are limiting the app’s enjoyment and accessibility for casual users.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Impact Score | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fun & Effective Learning** | 1044 | This dominant theme confirms Duolingo's successful gamification strategy, where users find the structure non-boring and conducive to fluency. The model of requiring only 20 minutes daily, with an option to watch a short ad for extra practice, is currently highly praised as a motivating, low-friction gateway. |
| **Course Gaps & Structure** | 93 | High-engagement users who complete courses are clearly seeking advanced retention tools. The immediate need is development of post-completion features, such as a "words of the week" section, to prevent loss of long-term users and maximize lifetime value. Content audits are also necessary for specific courses where vocabulary prioritization seems illogical (e.g., placing specialized words like "Wizard" early). |
| **Technical Issues/Bugs** | 34 | User sentiment is heavily polarized against the current 'energy system,' viewing it as punitive and frustrating compared to the previous 'hearts' system which only penalized incorrect answers. This design change is directly undermining the motivational aspect of the app. Furthermore, ongoing voice recognition failures on speaking exercises are costing users valuable practice attempts. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

**Fun & Effective Learning (Impact: 765)**
> "It's really good to learn a language... I've been addicted to learning German which I thought I would never say. All you need is 20 min everyday, and the energy system is good as well, if you want to practice more than 20 min, you watch a single short ad. Would recommend."

**Technical Issues/Bugs (Impact: 21)**
> "EDIT: Removing 2 stars from my previous review. The app used to have hearts that remained as long as you got everything correct, now it's got this stupid energy system that runs out regardless of how much you get right. That's not rewarding, it's frustrating. When I say EXACTLY what the app wants me to say it fails to hear me correctly and I get the answer wrong."

**Too Many Ads/Paywall (Impact: 16)**
> "I really loved it but the problem is that it was more fun when there was no subscription option . now its more likely to depend on subscription which make it kind of boring and difficult for those who cant pay..I used to use it as a hobby but just because of subscription and full of ads it has become limited..."

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **A/B Test the Energy System:** Immediately deploy A/B tests to compare retention and session length between the current "Energy System" and a revised system that rewards correctness (similar to the old 'hearts' model) to mitigate high-impact user frustration with the current punitive design.
2.  **Develop Post-Completion Content Pipeline:** Prioritize the introduction of a new, high-retention feature (e.g., a "Word Bank" or "Topic Expansion" module) to serve power users who have completed courses, leveraging the existing high satisfaction.
3.  **Conduct Voice Recognition Audit:** Initiate a focused engineering audit on the speaking exercise module, prioritizing resolution of common recognition failures that users report as inaccurate, ensuring that the feature does not lead to unfair depletion of the energy/life system.

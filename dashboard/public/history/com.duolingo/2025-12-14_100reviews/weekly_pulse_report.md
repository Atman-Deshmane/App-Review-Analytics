### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   "Charging system was fixed. However now the lessons are getting stuck/frozen at the end. Audio to text interpretation remains terrible. Audio quality in sentences remains spotty. Phrases are still repeated in the same lesson. I've learned enough of my language to realize some of their phrases and verb usage is wrong too. Google translate agrees." (Votes: 2607) - *This quote encapsulates the critical "App Bugs & Glitches" theme, highlighting multiple severe issues impacting the learning experience.*

*   "Duo is \"ok\" to learn French, with good improvements on the latest change. The ads in the past few months are ridiculously frequent, especially for their paid for plans. One is nagged after almost every disk is completed. Because of the la k of explanations of mistakes, even on the lowest paid version, I'm not upgrading. It's hard to revise specific words or concepts. Offline mode seems to be gone now as well." (Votes: 29) - *This quote powerfully illustrates the "User Experience Issues," detailing frustrations with ad saturation and a lack of essential learning support features.*

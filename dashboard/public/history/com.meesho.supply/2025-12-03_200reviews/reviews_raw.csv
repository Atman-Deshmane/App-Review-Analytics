Even though I face small issues in size of some dresses, overall looking it's so good. Just the delivery takes more time than other shopping apps. It will be good if you add more more suggestions for accessories. Overall satisfied with the product",1498,

I placed an order for several items, but once again the delivery attempt was marked as ""failed"" even though no one rang my doorbell, and the package never reached my doorstep. This is not an isolated incident every order I have placed in the past few weeks has faced the exact same problem: delivery attempts are falsely marked as failed, no proper contact is made, and eventually the orders gets cancelled.",1466,
2025-11-21 08:05:21,1,"Worst app, literally, the worst app.You should never use it.You can actually never use it there's so cunning like what they would do if you haven't put your address in that app, they would show the product with very less price. And once you put your address there, the prices will increase drastically like twice what they were before, if somehow you order at the less price, the price which was before adding the address they wouldn't deliver it saying that it was a delivery issue with no calls.",707,

2025-11-28 05:43:01,1,"I honestly don’t understand how Meesho is still functioning as a shopping platform. My experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. The quality of the products I received was absolutely horrible — nothing like the pictures shown. It felt like I paid for one thing and got a completely different, cheaper version of it. Customer support was equally disappointing. Getting help was almost impossible, and when I finally did, the responses were slow, unhelpful, and robotic. The return process was",445,

Their service and customer support is so poor. last time I placed an order with pay later option after receiving the product, I am trying to clear the dues(Rs.156/-) but it always says (please try again later) and I am getting daily whatsapp messages for due and legal process. Customer support is nothing. They clearly said we can't do anything. Meesho like this you will lose your valuable customer.",299,
2025-11-26 01:45:40,1,"I am extremely disappointed with the service. I placed a prepaid order on 14th November, and even after many days, the delivery has been unnecessarily delayed. The tracking has been stuck for a long time, and there is no proper update from the courier or the Meesho team.Even after raising multiple complaints, the only response I receive is that the issue has been ""escalated,"" but no real action is taken. There is no confirmed delivery date, no transparency, and no accountability from the team.",97,
2025-11-26 05:23:53,1,I have been using meesho for almost 2 years and ordered more than 50 times from meesho. I faced so many bad things but now it's in extreme cases because I've ordered a saree and a hotpot set from meesho. all of my items were in all issues returned but when I received the saree was very bad in quality and the hot pot set was broken. when I requested for return they kept it in under review even after 48 hours and also they removed the option of call back from my account.,54,

Every time I place an order, it gets cancelled or marked as undelivered without any proper reason. This is very frustrating and unprofessional. I have wasted my time waiting for the product, and the delivery service is very poor. Meesho needs to improve their delivery system .",47,
2025-11-24 14:40:14,3,Overall things are good though delivery system could be better as sometimes your order gets rejected by the delivery driver only even when you were available to take order and you can't even complain about it through app. Secondary issue is that delivery dates keep postponing than expected date. Kindly look after it. Thank you for overall Good experience.,30,

2025-11-21 05:58:09,1,"Worst experience with Meesho. Since 6 Nov I’ve been following up for a simple return pickup. The pickup agent kept giving excuses, even “forgot” to come, and Meesho wrongly marked it as customer not available. I kept calling customer care — always told to call after 2 hours. No proper support, chat is useless. And now on 21 Nov Meesho closed the return window without picking up the product and without giving my refund. This is absolutely unacceptable and the worst service ever.",25,
2025-11-20 18:19:42,1,I was a regular customer of meesho. Perhaps I have ordered more then 200 products from it. Had a great experience using this e commerce platform till the recent case where a wrong product was delivered to me and on making request for exchange I again received wrong product. When I complained about it no one was there to help and they even closed my query. Now I will think 100 times before using this platform.,21,
2025-11-22 11:31:34,1,The worst experience ever was when I ordered a product it was delivered after 1 month and also they have given me a different product now when I returned they were showing technical issues and the delivery boy rejected the product saying that they are not accepting now when I called at call center they are saying technical issue everytime they say the same guys I was not having the option of 0 start otherwise I might have selected that option,21,

Meesho will never ever ask you anything. The most interesting I found Candle which a non returnable item in all platform, Meesho has 7days return policy. They also showing customers free delivery but in backend adding delivery fees with the main selling price 😄😄. Meesho don't try to be act smart. We know ur strategy.",18,

2025-11-20 05:21:46,5,I have been using this Meesho app for the past 1 year. Bought so many products for the reasonable best price.

This delay is extremely inconvenient and unacceptable.I have checked the tracking status multiple times, but there is no further progress at all.

2025-11-21 05:26:30,1,"0/5 Stars. Warning! Meesho is scamming people. I ordered an item on Meesho to claim the maximum discount on my first order. I paid online. After 7 days, they cancelled the order from their side and told me to reorder the same product — which now costs more because I can’t use the discount again. Customer loss: 1. I lose the discount. 2. My money is stuck for a whole week. I will never order from Meesho again. Such a disgusting strategy to cheat customers.",8,
2025-11-22 05:39:59,5,"Really the application is very helpful and makes my online shopping easier, at reasonable prices.

2025-11-22 02:11:53,2,i have using meesho more than 3yrs but last one month I'm totally disappointed and uninstalled the app. i ordered two products which i didn't like so raised a return request. but still now no one will come and pick up the products. daily i called the help centre but their response is same. and the pick up request was rescheduled daily. totally disappointed ☹️,7,

I raised my concern to team, they just said it failed quality check so can't return it ,it's meesho policy. Very disappointed. I regret using this app . I lost my hard earned money, it's not a trustworthy platform. I didn't get any help for customer support. They just said we can't help.

2025-11-21 00:44:37,1,the worst shopping app ever! there is no delivery at time on given time neither the customer care of meesho nor delivery agent give any response.

2025-11-21 04:18:44,2,it's a good app for those who know how to purchase things... sometimes you'll not get products as expected but you can return also but the biggest issue with the app is it's delivery time ...whike flipkart and amazon are providing 1 or 2 day delivery for the same product. ...meesho takes more than a week...this is very frustrating,6,
2025-11-21 19:22:35,1,"meesho, A complete fraud company and a fraud app. You are cancelling the order after reaching its destination and when it suppose to be out for delivery.

2025-11-22 09:07:01,1,Meesho is a good shopping app but I haven't had a good experience recently. I had ordered a book series and it kept on getting delayed. And finally the order got cancelled. This is not good. I had ordered it to gift someone on their birthday and had to go without a present (shops are not nearby my house).,6,
2025-11-23 03:58:34,1,I didn’t receive a order ever which was given to me with a lot of discount like of 50 % and when i contact their customer care they say they will sort it but later in my tickets i see its closed and I never get my order on top of that when i tried to text an agent on the same day of delivery they say my Product was delivered 7 days ago and i cant do anything about it like seriously they have to improve their app as it glitches a lot and the ability to solve the issues faced by the customers too,6,

And the Experience with post order made me hate the app more. After waiting 7 days order got canceled automatically and got refund in 1 day. what I hated is the service post order and also that offer got used as well. So don't give offer if it is of no use.,3,

The products delivered are also good with grt quality for people living in a 3rd class city like Pune.",1,
2025-11-26 04:20:13,1,"As a seller, why there is no option for asking packet opening video proof from buyers/customers... in this e-commerce there are so many fraud customers who replace the original item and returns defective item where the real owner gets defective item... For this there is no action from meesho. Why?",1,

My aunt ordered from this 2 t shirts but received only one and she did cod . when I came to know about this I raised a concern to meesho app through their customer service on 17 November 2 times the case was closed without any resolution.

2025-11-30 09:06:17,1,"The service is very poor, I will not recommend Meesho to anyone. These people do not care about the customer's assurance. I ordered one of my products but it did not come for so many days, they lied about it and then cancelled it themselves and now I ordered another product which was not good but till now they are not even taking it back. Updates come daily, today we will come to collect it but no one has come. Today it has been like a month, they even delayed",1,

2025-11-27 04:26:57,1,"Meesho keeps delaying almost every order without any proper update. Delivery partners don’t call, mark “customer not available” even when someone is waiting, and tracking is completely useless. Customer support only gives copy-paste replies with no real solution. Every order becomes a headache. Meesho seriously needs to fix its delivery system and take responsibility",0,

2025-11-27 09:53:02,1,this app is totally fraud. when you see the price of any product here it's different but when you add it in your cart the price increases. They charge delivery fee for each product even if we are ordering many products.,0,

(I am changing my 5 star rating to 1 star, because I am using meesho from 2021, and I am telling you its been a whole scam journey, everyone trying to scam you. Sellers, buyers, even meesho.

2025-11-29 10:49:06,5,"I’ve been using Meesho for a while now and I’m honestly very happy with my experience. The app is simple to use, the variety of products is huge, and the prices are super affordable. Most of the items I ordered came exactly as shown in the pictures, and the quality was much better than I expected for the price. Delivery is usually on time, and I really like how easy their return and refund process is completely hassle-free. Customer support is also responsive and helpful whenever needed.",0,

2025-11-30 03:37:18,1,"I ordered a perfume from Meesho for the first time with a discount. The delivery showed 10 days, but on the 9th day they cancelled my order. If you use a discount, they cancel it and later the price becomes higher. Delivery is also much slower compared to Amazon and Flipkart. I realized Amazon is more trustworthy than Meesho.",0,
2025-11-30 03:40:51,5,"I want to give a suggestion that in the Meesho app, when we add products to the wishlist, everything comes into one single folder. It would be better if we could create separate folders like jewelry, clothes, decor, etc. That would make it easier",0,

2025-11-30 12:00:29,1,This is the most pathetic online shopping app where its impossible to return or exchange a product.The quantity of items delivered are always less then mention in description.Better to put some additional bucks and purchase from other online shopping apps.Not at all recommended!!!,0,

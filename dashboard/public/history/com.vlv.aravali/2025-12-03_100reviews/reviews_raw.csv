The older version was even more better, I was able to view the episode titles in the previous version, and also in this version, audios are getting paused in between.

2025-11-27 12:07:41,5,"Kuku FM is an excellent platform for listening to audiobooks and learning new things, especially for business and self-development. The content quality is very good, voices are clear, and episodes are easy to understand. I really like that it has books in simple language and multiple Indian languages. This app is very helpful for improving knowledge while saving time. I request more business category books and more latest book availability. Overall, great experience. 👍",27,
2025-11-21 02:45:33,1,"⚠️ SCAM ALERT: Kuku FM App – Unauthorized Deduction of ₹499 I want to warn others about my recent bad experience with the Kuku FM app. I tried to enter the app for a free trial, but without any clear consent or confirmation, the app automatically deducted ₹499 from my account. There was no proper notification, no warning, and no clear permission taken from me before charging the amount. This is extremely unethical, and many others seem to have faced similar issues according to online reviews.",23,

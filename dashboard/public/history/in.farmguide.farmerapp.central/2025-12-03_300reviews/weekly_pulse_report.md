## Weekly App Review Pulse: in.farmguide.farmerapp.central Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 03 Nov 2025 to 30 Nov 2025

### Executive Summary

Review volume remained exceptionally low this period, totaling only four submissions. Despite the minimal feedback, the highest impact concern reported focused on functional gaps, specifically the **"Missing Tools / Features"** theme. Critical friction points continue to jeopardize the user experience, notably a complete blockage during the registration process (IFSC issue) and severe lack of transparency in claims status and calculation details.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Theme | Count | Impact Score | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Tools / Features** | 1 | 1 | **Highest Impact Flag.** Although volume is low, this review registers the highest impact score, suggesting a genuine feature gap preventing the user from achieving necessary tasks or having a complete experience. Understanding what "special features" are missing is critical for roadmap planning. |
| **Claims & Calculation Issues** | 1 | 0 | **Trust Erosion.** The inability for users to understand *why* a claim was rejected or how the final amount was calculated is a significant impediment to platform trust and adoption of core financial features. Transparency here is non-negotiable. |
| **Registration & Setup Issues** | 1 | 0 | **Critical Onboarding Blocker.** A reported failure to proceed past the IFSC code entry constitutes a hard stop for new user acquisition. This technical defect must be treated as a Priority 1 bug hindering growth metrics. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

| Theme | Quote |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Registration & Setup Issues** | "on registration after entry of IFSC code no further process is complete" |
| **Missing Tools / Features** | "lack of special features,,,,,, " |
| **Claims & Calculation Issues** | "unable to follow claim status why it was rejected claim amount calculation etc" |

### 3. Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize Registration Defect Fix:** Immediately triage and resolve the bug preventing registration completion after IFSC code entry. This bottleneck is directly impacting new user sign-ups and must be eliminated.
2.  **Enhance Claims Transparency:** Update the claims tracking module to clearly display the precise reason for claim rejection and provide a detailed, easy-to-understand breakdown of the amount calculation methodology.
3.  **Initiate Feature Discovery:** Launch a targeted, lightweight user survey or in-app prompt to define what "special features" (the highest impact concern) users are requesting, feeding concrete feature requirements into the Q1 2026 roadmap.

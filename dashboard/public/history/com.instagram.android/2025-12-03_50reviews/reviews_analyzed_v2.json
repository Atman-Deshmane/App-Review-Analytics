It's my main source of inspiration, whether it's for travel, food, or just cool art. Stories and Reels are a fun way to share quick moments, and I find it\u2019s a much more positive and curated space than other social media platforms.",

What a joke!! 0 stars and two thumbs down. STILL HAVING ISSUES!! Can't edit, freezes most of the time. New update is glitching, won't bring up tools, and tools aren't as easily accessible and less user-friendly. Can't edit pics.",

I hope u sort this out",

There's pretty much only social media marketing here and a few small businesses, and it's lost its original intention of being a photo sharing app. The customer service is also pretty much not there at all and there is no moderation of comments, so it's become a hot bed for the worst possible responses on social media to exist so much so its a joke.",

The newest app layout where they made it possible to swipe from the homepage to the reels page is a doomscroller's horror and the messages are no longer a swipe away. You're easily repurposing your app. At least make the feature toggleable - consider that not everyone would like to watch brainrot and would rather text their friends and family instead.",

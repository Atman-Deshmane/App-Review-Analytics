## Weekly App Review Pulse: com.myntra.android Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 26 Nov 2025 to 06 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

App reviews during this period are dominated by critical failures in the customer support system, evidenced by the "Bad Customer Service" theme registering a disproportionate Impact Score of 7904. Customers are reporting severe difficulty accessing self-serve options and connecting with human agents, leading to high-visibility frustration that is compounding post-purchase operational issues, particularly around returns and refunds. We must treat the broken support flow as a critical product failure requiring immediate mitigation.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Bad Customer Service** | **7904** | 5 | **Critical Failure in Support Flow.** This theme carries 94% of the combined reported impact, signaling a massive operational and app friction point. Reports indicate users cannot navigate the 'Contact Us' flow effectively, with core functions (like reaching a human agent or initiating specific query types) being broken or deliberately obfuscated. This is eroding trust rapidly. |
| **2** | **Other** | 818 | 63 | **New Update Friction.** While broad, the high volume of reviews coupled with the quote regarding complexity suggests significant backlash against a recent app update. The negative experience of navigating the new UI is likely contributing to the high support load and general dissatisfaction. |
| **3** | **Return/Refund Issues** | 471 | 8 | **Compounding Post-Purchase Failure.** This theme highlights systemic breakdowns (e.g., successful pick-ups being marked as "failed" and subsequently cancelled). Crucially, the customer’s inability to connect with reliable support (Theme #1) means these issues remain unresolved, driving severe anger and negative sentiment. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

The following quotes illustrate the immediate pain points driving the high impact scores:

| Theme | Quote (Votes) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bad Customer Service** | "2025-Reduced to 1 star. This app is going downhill. Contact Us-How Do You Want to Contact Us pop up contains only cancel icon.Lol. To connect with human agent is a dream (: 2024 (3*)-The flow was wonderful an year or so back. The Support feature is a task, hidden away in order of order." **(Votes: 7898)** |
| **Return/Refund Issues** | "Terrible service. I placed an order from Myntra. The product was of worst quality, so I requested a return. The product was picked up from my location the next day, and the status showed 'return picked up failed. Now, when I'm trying to connect with customer support i don't get option to connect." **(Votes: 250)** |
| **Other (UX/Updates)** | "I really hate the new update . the new update just made the app harder to use . like why do you need to complex thinhs ?" **(Votes: 600)** |

### 3. Recommended Actions

Based on the immediate and critical impact of the support failures, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **URGENT: Repair the Contact Flow Functionality:** Immediately escalate and fix the specific product failure in the "Contact Us" pop-up flow to ensure customers can select a query type and initiate contact, especially for high-priority actions like connecting to a live agent.
2.  **Audit End-to-End Return Resolution Path:** Conduct a deep dive into the technical trigger behind the 'Return Picked Up Failed' status. Simultaneously, ensure that any canceled or failed return immediately auto-generates a high-priority, dedicated, and easily accessible support ticket pathway to prevent customers from being stranded without resolution options.
3.  **Investigate Recent UX/UI Updates:** Launch a targeted review of all changes introduced in the most recent app update, specifically focusing on simplifying navigation and reducing perceived complexity cited by the large volume of 'Other' reviews. Prioritize user pathways that were recently altered.

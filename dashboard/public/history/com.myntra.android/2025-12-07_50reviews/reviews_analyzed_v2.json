I wrote one review where the product material was deliberately misguided by the supplier, They said pure cotton but it was cheap polyster. myntra rejected my review saying its related to sales service. How can we trust a platform which hides authentic reviews and gives false reviews only to customers. If you want to check see 1 star reviews you will not find description. There is no real way to get human customer support. Pathetic Customer care. Amazon is better.",

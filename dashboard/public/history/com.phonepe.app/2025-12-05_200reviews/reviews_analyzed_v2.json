Update: I had to add this to expose their trick. As a response to my review, they asked for more details. But I already had a month long ticket with them that they never bothered to resolve. Update 2025 Still the worst app. Credit card application form DOB field has a bug causing it to start a date counter back wards. Pathetic.",

2025-11-25 13:46:45,4,"In today’s digital era, PhonePe has been very helpful for me. I am satisfied with its services such as on-time payments, successful transactions even in low network conditions, instant transaction alerts, and especially the security alerts for unknown or potentially fraudulent payment parties. However, along with these useful features, I have also faced some issues. Even after long-term usage, I do not receive cashback or reward bonuses. Phone verification is often required again while accessis",2306,
2025-11-28 12:20:17,5,"Ireally appreciate this app, but I think it would be great if it had a separate savings feature. This would allow users, especially students, to set aside money for future use, keeping it separate from their spending money. Currently, it's easy to spend all our money on payments, leaving nothing for savings. A dedicated savings option would be a wonderful addition to the app.",841,

2025-12-01 14:56:57,5,I've been using this app for more than an year. Both receiving and payment takes place smoothly. It helps me to pay exact money to the shop keeper without buying chocolates for changes. It actually stopped me going to ATM. It also helps me in my businesses.,98,
2025-11-22 14:27:16,2,"Reason why phonepe se not my default app- Cons: -Delay notification (Already reported several times but not fixed yet I don't want to receive payment notification after 24 hours after the actual time), Lack of cashback as compared to Amazon pay, Useless voucher, Need improvement in payment history Pros: -Clean UI as compared to other UPI apps, Customisation of UPI ID",80,

2025-11-30 17:07:41,5,"After a long time, I was able to log in to my PhonePe account, and it is functioning smoothly at present.

2025-11-27 04:40:40,1,"My issue still exists even after multiple attempts to resolve it. It has been over a week and the bank account activation error is still not fixed.

2025-11-23 07:10:42,2,"I’m facing a serious issue with my PhonePe login/reset process. Whenever I enter my password, the app says it’s incorrect. When I try to reset it, the reset works, but after creating a new password, the app again says the password is wrong. I’ve tried multiple times, but the same problem continues. Please help me understand why the password is not being accepted even after a successful reset. I need this resolved so I can access my account normally.",26,
2025-11-29 13:21:52,1,"I reached out to the customer care helpline because I’ve been having a serious issue: my account balance dropped to zero without any transaction from my end. When I called, I ended up talking to an AI system that didn’t really understand the issue and couldn’t assist me properly. I also sent an email but haven’t received any response yet. Overall, I’m quite frustrated with the lack of support and I’m considering leaving a review on the app about this experience.",24,

2025-11-26 12:24:03,1,"This app has a super frustrating glitch. When I open it, it skips the MPIN screen and goes straight to the home page. A few seconds later it suddenly asks for the MPIN, and if I’ve already tapped something on the screen before it, the fingerprint and password buttons stop working. I get stuck on the fingerprint screen for eternity and have to restart my phone every time. It’s happened 7–8 times and it’s honestly ridiculous. Phone-pe more like Pain-pe.",9,

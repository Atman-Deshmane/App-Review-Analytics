2025-12-09 11:48:09,5,"It's been a while I'm using this platform for my investment specially for buying stocks and SIP investment, this charts are very easy to consume, I would recommend this app for everyone, it's an effortless thing to do.",3438,
2025-12-11 13:01:49,4,one suggestion regarding alerts .... users must be able to keep alerts for 1 year as your peer - zerodha has the same feature and going 1 step forward a order can be placed once the price touch that trigger price / target price if we have sufficient amt in the wallet... and 2nd - news section regarding a particular stock is not up to the mark... otherwise fantastic app - that's why I have cut 1 star....🙏🙏,490,
2025-12-11 12:03:49,2,"Groww charts are very basic and the team is not releasing any updates at all. No features like a traders diary, multiple watchlists, order tabs are creating confusion. Events calendar don't have any alert option. No notes to the watchlist. The customer support is very delayed and no one is interested in taking the feedback as well. no updates to groww charts from 3.5 months, groww team is not responding on this at all.",347,
2025-12-17 10:12:49,4,"The app is superb, but it lacks certain features offered by other platforms available on the market. It needs to add the automatic trailing stop-loss feature, which will be highly useful for intraday users. Moreover, the recently added exit button in the intraday section is a welcome addition, but it often fails to function properly to execute orders quickly. That needs to be improved upon to make it faster and more accurate. Also, the charges are really high compared to many other platforms",287,
2025-12-15 09:21:05,4,"Nice app,clean UX.Will be nice to add LRS for investments in foreign MF. And, sector of company is not displayed if it has options chain. Better move sector details into 'About Company' section. And,managing list of stock price alerts in one place is hard to find. Good to provide an edit alerts icon where we open notifications from profile page.",287,
2025-12-12 04:03:04,4,"I like using the Groww app, but I have one major issue. The charges that get deducted are not clearly explained. When any amount is charged, there are no proper details or breakdown provided. It becomes confusing to understand why the charges were applied. Please improve the transparency of charges and provide clear details so users can track everything easily. Otherwise, the app experience is good, but this issue needs to be fixed.",193,
2025-12-11 07:57:39,5,"To Team Groww, I request you to kindly update the UI of the app , allowing us to use the app in landscape mode as well. This will be helpful in charting and easier to use in tablet. Currently the app only works in vertical portrait mode which is really troublesome to use in my Tablet and i have to login via web to operate properly.",190,
2025-12-15 04:09:38,4,I have used many apps but this ones my favourite. The interface of the app is very simple and minimalistic with all the requirements I need to look to but I have one request to groww that please offer a brokerage free plan and keep the free plan also but brokerage free plan helps to daily traders a lot. Other than that everything is awesome. Edit: And also add daily profit and loss section for delivery buy \ sell.,79,
2025-12-12 15:08:30,1,"07/12/2025 I have been using this app for some time now. But when I started intraday trading, i encountered its high slippage. For example, I book a trade at a profit of around 12000 using their exit button, the executed amount would be 10000. There have been times when booked a profit of more than 2000 still the executed profit was not only less but in loss -749. This is higly disappointing. Now I'm looking for a new broker app. Too much Fraud app. I have lost 20000 rupees on this app. Hence",73,
2025-12-11 05:16:06,1,the customer care support is pathetic. you are never going to receive a call whenever you will request and they will close the ticket without resolution. being a very long term user I will caution everyone to stay attentive. Some of the stocks are not visible in the portfolio. looks like some technical error.,39,
2025-12-14 09:55:07,1,"the app freezing or getting stuck, which makes it difficult to use. Here's a breakdown of the issue, which can be shared with the developers: Problem: The app is not working properly. Specifics: It gets stuck or freezes, making it unresponsive. Impact: This issue is preventing the user from performing actions within the app.",29,
2025-12-08 05:12:04,1,"Worst experience from the customer service team. I was unable to modify my F&O sell order and while I checked with the customer service team through chat support, they instructed me to uninstall and reinstall the GROWW app. they are unable to point out the issue. also, even after I reinstalled the app..the situation was same.. Also, no further executives are replying through chat support..they are online but jus not responding back.. Marvellous service from GROWW!! Don't recommend this app!!",19,
2025-12-15 01:35:16,1,"I am extremely disappointed with Groww due to lack of transparency in settlement and fund reconciliation. Profits and option premiums were clearly visible in the app, but the final available balance did not match these figures. Despite providing screenshots with date and time, customer support kept saying the “amount is already settled” without sharing any ledger or contract-note-based explanation. This creates serious trust issues, especially for F&O trading, please don't choose Groww App 🙏",17,
2025-12-18 16:02:51,4,"Team, in Mutual funds -> Dashboard -> All orders, when I change tabs between Stocks, Mutual funds, and Bills & recharges, the list is not refreshing properly. It is appending the data instead of refreshing. Please check and fix, very irritating.",16,

2025-12-13 22:07:10,5,"Hi, When we talk about brokerage platforms in India, Groww is one of the top names and is often considered among the No.1 brokers. However, there is one serious issue that I have been noticing for a long time. Whenever we do options buying, the app often lags or hangs, especially during high volatility. This glitch has happened many times and has caused significant losses. I sincerely want to request the Groww team to please look into this issue and bring a new update or improvement in the app",5,

2025-12-20 03:34:30,1,"Hello Groww Team, I would like to share some feedback regarding the investment tracking in the app. I have invested a total of ₹43,502.36 in Groww shares. I sold shares worth ₹15,600, so my remaining investment should be ₹28,402.36. However, the app currently shows only ₹25,697. This creates confusion for users trying to track their investments accurately. It would be great if the app could display the correct remaining investment amount to improve transparency and trust. Thank you",3,

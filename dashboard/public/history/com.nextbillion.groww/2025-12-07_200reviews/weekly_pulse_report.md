**Reporting Period:** 24 Nov 2025 to 06 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary

The reporting period validates Groww's continued competitive advantage in user experience, with high positive sentiment focused on the simple UI (7570 Impact Score). However, the most significant high-impact negative theme centers on **Missing Trading Features** (6772 Impact Score from only 25 reviews), driven overwhelmingly by a specific, high-vote request for advanced indicators. This indicates a maturing user base demanding professional-grade tooling.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

| Rank | Theme | Impact Score | Review Count | Strategic Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Other (Positive Feedback)** | 7,570 | 101 | **Core Strength Validation:** Our simple UI and beginner-friendly approach remain the highest-impact positive driver. We must ensure this ease-of-use is protected as we onboard more complex features. |
| 2 | **Missing Trading Features** | 6,772 | 25 | **Critical Feature Gap:** This theme shows extremely high negative intensity. The user demand for the 'stochastic indicator' is non-negotiable for retaining and satisfying active traders, signaling a necessary shift in feature priority to support sophistication. |
| 3 | **Poor Customer Support** | 218 | 10 | **Automation Success, Human Funnel Failure:** Users highly praise the speed and efficacy of the AI Voice Assistant. Conversely, the human support channel is criticized for excessive connection time (7-8 minutes), suggesting the human routing process requires immediate streamlining. |

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

**A. Critical Feature Demand (Missing Trading Features - 5731 Votes)**
> "please add stochastic indicator, which is very useful"

**B. Core Strength & UI (Other - 3574 Votes)**
> "it's been 1.5 years I am using groww. However since then till now they have improved a lot. They have improved their UI which is very easy for beginners. I prefer this app over any other investment apps coz of it's simple UI."

**C. Reliability & Monetary Trust (High Charges & Fees - 71 Votes)**
> "Too late response in option trading.. Even after setting the stop loss at a particular price, it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss. And on top of that the hidden charges ..Resulting P&L shows different after the day and when the amount reflects it is always lower..."

### 3. Recommended Actions

*   **Prioritize Advanced Tools:** Immediately elevate the "Stochastic Indicator" request to a top-priority engineering item, leveraging the overwhelming user demand to push it into the upcoming feature release roadmap.
*   **Optimize Support Funnel:** Conduct an urgent audit of the human customer support call flow to reduce the average time-to-representative connection from 7-8 minutes to under 3 minutes, utilizing triage logic proven successful by the AI assistant.
*   **Investigate Trade Reliability:** Launch a focused investigation into stop-loss execution latency and transparency regarding 'hidden charges' to address fundamental user trust issues regarding trading fidelity and final P&L reconciliation.

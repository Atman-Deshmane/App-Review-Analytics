## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 02, 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Critical Instability Threat:** User feedback this week is dominated by severe technical reliability failures related to **Order & App Glitches**, which accounted for 87% of the total community impact score (1,832 votes). Users are reporting critical latency in Intraday order placement, resulting in lost profits and explicit threats of migration to competitor platforms.
*   **Immediate Retention Risk:** The nature of the top complaint—direct financial loss due to platform failure—elevates this issue beyond typical bugs to an existential reliability crisis that requires immediate, centralized engineering intervention and clear user communication.
*   **Operational and Feature Friction:** Secondary strategic focus areas include product depth (adding a 10-year view for Mutual Fund charts) and improving customer experience speed, specifically by streamlining the 7-8 minute-long human call center routing process.

### Top 5 Themes (Ranked by User Impact)

| Theme Name | Community Impact Score (Total Thumbs Up) | Voice of the Customer | Quote Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Order & App Glitches** | **1832** | "Really disappointed been using the app from almost 8 months initially the app was very good but now its buggy like hell every other day cannot place orders. When placing order in intraday it place order really late and sometimes even after 20 mins order pending and when the place the order already miss on profits..." | (Votes: 688) |
| **Feature Requests** | **236** | "Very good app,though there is one limitation, that is a 10 year section not available for mutual funds when sorting or viewing any individual funds chart,it is important since it gives more long term perspective..." | (Votes: 180) |
| **Other** | **24** | "The app is good, but the call center experience isn’t. I prefer your AI Voice Assistant because it solves my problem in just 30–50 seconds. In a human call... The whole process takes around 7–8 minutes." | (Votes: 24) |
| **Hidden Fees & Charges** | **11** | "Too late response in option trading... Even after setting the stop loss at a particular price, it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss. And on top of that the hidden charges... there is always 200-500 rs difference..." | (Votes: 11) |
| **App Layout & Usability** | **5** | "The brokerage rates are attractive, but the app has usability issues, instead if showing the dashboard after login, the app shows explore, in MF section, the executed orders do not show buying NAV rate and Units allocated..." | (Votes: 5) |

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Launch "Intraday Stability War Room":** Immediately activate a high-priority 72-hour engineering sprint dedicated solely to diagnosing and resolving the severe order placement latency and "buggy" performance issues identified in the top theme. This must include root cause analysis on the reported 20-minute order delays in Intraday trading. Simultaneously, deploy an in-app banner assuring users of the immediate resolution efforts to mitigate retention risks.

2.  **Enhance Regulatory/Fee Transparency and Execution Quality:** Address the combined concerns of slippage/stop-loss failures and opaque deductions. Prioritize improving trade execution consistency, particularly in options trading. Concurrently, develop an intuitive, post-trade transparency module within the P&L statement that clearly itemizes all non-brokerage regulatory and hidden charges, eliminating the reported Rs 200-500 discrepancy.

3.  **Optimize Long-Term Investment Tools and Support Speed:** Instruct the Product team to prioritize two key experience improvements:
    *   **Feature Parity:** Add the requested 10-year charting view for Mutual Funds to support long-term investment research and conviction building.
    *   **Support Efficiency:** Review and streamline the IVR/human call routing process to dramatically reduce the current 7-8 minute wait time, ensuring that human support speed more closely aligns with the efficiency currently demonstrated by the 30-50 second AI Voice Assistant experience.

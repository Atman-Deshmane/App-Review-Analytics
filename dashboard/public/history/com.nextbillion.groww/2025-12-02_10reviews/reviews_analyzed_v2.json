When placing order in intraday it place order really late and sometimes even after 20 mins order pending and when the place the order already miss on profits. Even today market is open from 15 mins and still can't place new orders really getting in my nerves now. If you guys keep on going like this wont take long for people to move to others",

I have seen too many glitches in the recent days, sometimes wallet balance is incorrect, sometimes login doesn't work, sometimes you can't make payments etc etc. With every glitch, my trust is eroding from this app. Update (23 Oct 2025) - I don't think they are able to handle the volume of transactions happening on their platform. Glitches still occur and now happen repeatedly. Price alerts for ETFs do not work at all.",

## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing

**Reporting Period:** 12 Jan 2026 to 25 Jan 2026

### Executive Summary

This period, "Easy To Use" continues its dominance, driven by overwhelmingly positive feedback on the digital account opening process. However, a concerning trend emerges with customer support, where recent negative experiences are significantly impacting user sentiment, juxtaposed against a continued positive perception of Groww's ease of use.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

*   **Easy To Use (Impact Score: 33304, Review Count: 65):** This theme remains the strongest driver of positive sentiment. The digital and paperless account opening process is a significant win, particularly for new investors. The seamless, step-by-step guidance is consistently praised for its user-friendliness and hassle-free nature.
*   **App Performance (Impact Score: 156, Review Count: 32):** While the impact score is lower, specific bugs like the non-functional "Exit" button in Scalper mode are directly impacting user experience and need immediate attention to maintain app stability.
*   **Charges and Fees (Impact Score: 142, Review Count: 17):** User sentiment around charges is volatile and has worsened, with a reported increase in fees and a desire for more customization to disable irrelevant features like "Loan" and "F&O" for delivery traders. This suggests a growing frustration with perceived value for money.

*   "Looking for zero brokerage on delivery trades. Edited: High charges. Edited: Again they hiked charges. Planning to close account. Edited: If someone is not interested in F&O and Loan menu then you should provide an option to disable through customisation. These options decrease the speed of traders. They distract us."

### 3. Recommended Actions

*   **Enhance Customer Support Responsiveness:** Prioritize addressing the critical feedback on customer support's inability to provide timely and accurate information, and low call pick-up rates. Implement a system to track and resolve open queries with urgency.
*   **Investigate and Fix Critical Bugs:** Immediately investigate and resolve the reported bug with the "Exit" button in Scalper mode to prevent further user frustration and ensure core functionality.
*   **Review Fee Structure and Feature Customization:** Evaluate the recent charge hikes and consider user feedback on providing customization options to disable features not relevant to all user segments, particularly for delivery traders.

The UI is clean, and it's beginner-friendly. However, one feature that could take it to the next level would be stock recommendations for both long-term investments and short-term trades (like swing trading). It would be super helpful to get insights, expert analysis, or even curated stock lists based on different time horizons and risk appetites.",

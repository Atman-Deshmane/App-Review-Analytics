## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing

**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 02, 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Critical Reliability Breach in IPO Process:** The highest impact theme identifies severe technical friction during IPO application submission, where the process is getting stuck ("sending application to exchange"). This not only generates user frustration but actively drives users to consider competitors (AngelOne, INDmoney) cited as having superior speed and reliability in this critical conversion funnel.
*   **Growing Demand for Sophisticated Advisory Tools:** User feedback indicates a platform maturity shift, with customers now seeking advanced, value-added features like curated stock recommendations and expert analysis tailored for specific trading strategies (e.g., long-term vs. swing trading). This represents a clear product opportunity to increase engagement and time-on-app.
*   **Urgency for Competitive Technical Parity:** The direct comparison to competitor submission speeds for IPOs necessitates immediate engineering prioritization to diagnose and resolve the bottleneck in exchange communication and mandate generation, as failure here directly impacts capital deployment and user trust.

### Top 2 Themes (Ranked by User Impact)

*(Note: Data reflects the two highest-impact themes identified across the 25 total reviews this period.)*

| Theme Name | Community Impact Score (Total Thumbs Up) | Voice of the Customer | Quote Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test Theme** (IPO Application Failure) | **7,546** | "This is one of the best platforms for investment, but applying for an IPO is frustrating. Recently, the application process gets stuck on 'sending application to exchange,' failing to generate a number or send a mandate. Other platforms like AngelOne and INDmoney are much faster." | (Votes: 2,009) |
| **Other** (Feature Request: Stock Recommendations) | **5,595** | "The UI is clean, and it's beginner-friendly. However, one feature that could take it to the next level would be stock recommendations for both long-term investments and short-term trades (like swing trading). It would be super helpful to get insights..." | (Votes: 2,353) |

### Strategic Recommendations

#### 1. Technical Reliability: Immediate IPO Application Fix

**Action:** Initiate a high-priority 'War Room' investigation targeting the latency and failure points in the IPO submission API, specifically the transition phase between application submission and exchange confirmation/mandate generation.
**Goal:** Achieve (and publish) submission times that demonstrably match or exceed the competitors (AngelOne, INDmoney) cited by users. This instability is a high-cost failure impacting user trust during market-sensitive events.

#### 2. Product Roadmap: Explore Value-Added Advisory

**Action:** Authorize a dedicated discovery sprint within the Product and Research teams to scope the complexity and potential ROI of implementing integrated Stock Recommendation features.
**Focus:** Recommendations must segment the user base (beginner vs. experienced) and the investment time horizon (long-term buy-and-hold vs. swing/short-term trade ideas) to genuinely add value beyond existing basic screeners.

#### 3. Competitive Intelligence: Performance Benchmarking

**Action:** Integrate a formal process for continuously monitoring and benchmarking key technical user journeys (specifically IPO submission speed and high-volume trade execution) against top competitors on a weekly basis.
**Goal:** Establish clear, measurable internal KPIs for "Time to Exchange Confirmation" to proactively identify performance regressions before they generate widespread negative customer reviews.

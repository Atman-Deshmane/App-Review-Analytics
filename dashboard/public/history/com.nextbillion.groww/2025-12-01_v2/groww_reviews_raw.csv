2025-10-10 11:50:33,5,"I have opened a demat account using this app & it is very easy. and this investment app is one of the best trading apps that I have ever used. The platform offers seamless mutual fund investments, stock trading, and SIP options. The user-friendly interface makes investing hassle-free, while real-time tracking ensures transparency. I love the zero-commission feature and fast withdrawals. Highly recommend this app👍",3574,
2025-09-19 11:54:11,4,"I've been using the Groww app for a while now, and it's fantastic for tracking investments, mutual funds, and buying/selling stocks. The UI is clean, and it's beginner-friendly. However, one feature that could take it to the next level would be stock recommendations for both long-term investments and short-term trades (like swing trading). It would be super helpful to get insights, expert analysis, or even curated stock lists based on different time horizons and risk appetites.",2344,
2025-09-19 11:41:58,4,"This is one of the best platforms for investment, but applying for an IPO is frustrating. Recently, the application process gets stuck on ""sending application to exchange,"" failing to generate a number or send a mandate. Other platforms like AngelOne and INDmoney are much faster. But I prefer using Groww, so I often have to cancel and reapply to get my application submitted, which is especially stressful on the final day.",1998,
2025-11-02 16:08:18,5,"Super impressed! The documentation process was incredibly quick and effortless. All my mutual funds were auto-loaded from the central repository, requiring zero manual effort. The best part was that it even retrieved some of my old mutual funds that I no longer had records of. I also raised a redemption request, which was processed swiftly. If the payout is completed within the estimated timeline, this would be an outstanding overall experience.",1462,
2025-11-09 19:36:29,5,"Couple of issues that can be addressed. Many brokers allow the details of the trades along with the charges to be downloaded in the Excel format for uploading the data to another Excel sheet maintained by them. Groww needs to work on this aspect. 2. when I transact, the rate given on the screen is seemed to be higher than prevailing rate if a buy is being placed and similar for a sell transaction. I would like a situation where the rate on the screen is blank and filled by the trader.",1022,
2025-09-20 21:39:56,5,A suggestion to include portfolio analyser where market cap allocation and percentage allocation of each stock is shown which is available in kite. The latest update has portfolio analyser and xirr indicator which is exactly what I had wanted. Great The app keeps getting better with every update. Now it u can also import the stocks from the other broker app u have two accounts. Can compare xirr with nifty returns. Great tools to analyze the portfolio. There is no need for a third party app,938,
2025-10-31 01:23:27,4,"Groww is one of the smoothest and easiest apps for beginners in trading and investing. The interface is clean, buying and selling stocks is simple, and GTT orders make it beginner-friendly. However, the app still needs a few advanced features like stop-loss / take-profit for delivery trades and trailing stop-loss options for swing traders. Adding those would make Groww perfect for both new and active users. Overall, it’s great for starting out, learning, and building a long-term portfolio",895,
2025-09-21 08:41:24,1,"The employees always use a sentance to blame their short comings on either Sebi guidelines or network server problem. Of lately they have found a new person to blame for their short comings in running the app without lags or glitches - AI tools. But they will never admit their fault that they are running a faulty app full of lags, glitches and false timing data charts. The data displayed is not in real time, you place three different monitors you will have three different data displayed. Why?",874,
2025-10-06 00:54:24,5,"Best experience 👌 overall! But I faced one issue — I bought 3 stocks and tried paying via Fampay UPI but the payment didn’t go through. Also, the brokerage charges feel a bit high — even when I get ₹2–₹3 profit, ₹10–₹20 gets deducted, which is frustrating. Please fix this issue, otherwise Groww is really one of the best and most user-friendly trading apps! 🔥",873,
2025-10-03 09:27:58,1,"I regret choosing this platform. While the user interface looks polished and onboarding was smooth, the app fails spectacularly at the absolute most critical time for any trader: market opening. Every single morning, without fail, as the clock hits 9:15 AM (or within the first five crucial minutes), the servers completely seize up. The app becomes unresponsive, trades won't execute, and worst of all, I can't exit positions. This isn't a minor glitch; it is a fundamental flaw",697,
2025-11-12 22:41:06,1,Really disappointed been using the app from almost 8 months initially the app was very good but now its buggy like hell every other day cannot place orders. When placing order in intraday it place order really late and sometimes even after 20 mins order pending and when the place the order already miss on profits. Even today market is open from 15 mins and still can't place new orders really getting in my nerves now. If you guys keep on going like this wont take long for people to move to others,679,
2025-10-23 13:36:22,1,"The app is becoming worse day by day. I have seen too many glitches in the recent days, sometimes wallet balance is incorrect, sometimes login doesn't work, sometimes you can't make payments etc etc. With every glitch, my trust is eroding from this app. Update (23 Oct 2025) - I don't think they are able to handle the volume of transactions happening on their platform. Glitches still occur and now happen repeatedly. Price alerts for ETFs do not work at all.",661,
2025-09-18 21:01:13,1,#Go for another broker. This app has been giving a lot of issues. It is not working well in the commodity section. While putting buy/sell orders in options the executed orders don't appear immediately in the positions . it takes a lot of time. Very slow app. The interface was not this bad earlier. Bugs may be there too. The Worst customer service. Calls are not picked up.,644,
2025-10-24 11:50:48,5,"I've been using Groww for over a year now, and it's hands down the best stock trading platform. The app is super intuitive, and the equity delivery is a game changer. Their charts and tools for market analysis are spot on. I highly recommend Groww for anyone serious about investing in stocks or mutual funds.",578,
2025-10-16 12:23:38,1,"I'm very disappointed with this app. Used to like this app because of it's super fast order placements and simple UI. but on 14th October, I was placing my order to sell shares of LG at 50% but due to some error I wasn't able to sell. I tried 4 times but it failed. After 15minutes, I did sell the shares but at less profit at 44%. Hence I was able to book less profit. If such problem continues I may suffer a huge loss in the future. that's why I don't want to use this app anymore.",574,
2025-11-19 10:38:41,2,"when try to invest in new mutual fund it says ""you cannot invest in any new mutual fund schemes because your kyc verification is incomplete."" when i click on that text it say ""you are not allowed to perform this action"". even if i goto setting page there is no kyc renewal option. feeling helpless.",555,
2025-09-12 10:18:30,4,"Groww app is quite fast. I just started using it for stocks and mutual fund investments. However on first look, the info displayed on screen (holdings/dashboard) is quite minimal. Like other apps eg Kite(Zerodha), or Paytm money, it is advisable to display all info at one screen, eg no of shares, buying price, current LTP, profit/loss amount and percentage etc.. Same info also missing in mutual funds dashboard.. All info should get displayed in one screen. Rather than clicking many times.",502,
2025-10-02 22:29:03,5,"*""Groww is one of the best investment platforms I have used. The app is extremely simple, fast, and user-friendly, making stock market and mutual fund investing very easy, even for beginners. The interface is clean with no unnecessary clutter, and transactions (buy/sell, fund transfer, IPO applications) are smooth and transparent.",487,
2025-09-12 23:58:06,5,"I really appreciate the latest updates on Groww – the platform keeps getting better and more user-friendly with every version. The new features have made investing and tracking much more convenient. At the same time, I would like to suggest one addition that would be very useful for long-term investors: an option to view dividend yield stocks directly. Having this feature would make it easier to analyze and plan investments for steady long-term returns. Overall, I’m very happy with Groww .",474,
2025-10-15 05:27:15,1,"This is the worst platform for trading and investing, especially for beginners. They bail out on you at the very crucial moment. I have been trying to sell my share from yesterday, either app crashes during procedures or even after completing all procedures my order is not placed. It's just not that even during the purchase app crashes like it's deliberately doesn't want you to make profit. I'm so much disappointed.",473,
2025-09-20 13:49:56,1,"For the past few days, I’ve been unable to open the app and keep getting the error “OOPS, SOMETHING WENT WRONG.” I updated the app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it. After logging in, it worked fine the day before yesterday, but now I’m facing the same error again when opening the app. My internet bandwidth is good, so I’m not sure why the app is behaving like this.",385,

2025-10-03 14:49:43,5,"""Groww is more than just an investment app; it's a great educational tool. The informative blogs and resources helped me learn the basics of investing and make better-informed decisions. Fantastic for anyone new to the market."" ""Before I started using Groww, investing felt complicated and intimidating. The seamless, paperless account opening and simple design removed all the barriers. It took me just a few minutes to set up and start my SIPs. The experience has been lovely."" 💯❣️",357,
2025-10-08 00:34:20,1,"12/09/24- Don't download this app. It is the most unreliable app which has a lot of issues. They credit wrong day NAV, IPO page never loads, even if you apply for IPO, you will not receive any mandate request. Issue with loading money to wallet when you most need it. The UI may be appealing but under the hood it is the most unreliable app. Lost a lot of opportunities due to this app. Worst experience. 08/10/25- App is still full of issues. Very unreliable. Still wrong NAV is credited.",357,
2025-09-27 11:31:29,1,"Heard about it from a friend. But had to immediately uninstalled. At initial setup, it's too easy to accidentally choose some options. You can't go back and correct the choices. And these can not be changed later in settings as well. Also it's terrible at account deletion. Once in, it's a nightmare to exit. Do not get into the trap!",338,
2025-10-10 21:27:40,5,"I have tried multiple apps for my investment, but one thing I like the most about Groww is their easy interface. The UI is so simple that a beginner can invest very easily. I use this app to invest in IPO and sip. It's super easy and most importantly it's very trustworthy. your money is safe. And their customer support team is also very cooperative and helpful. really deserved a 5 star!! although I don't often give review but the easy ui made me to do so👍",338,
2025-09-30 07:41:23,2,"Groww charts are very basic and the team is not releasing any updates at all. No features like a traders diary, multiple watchlists, order tabs are creating confusion. Events calendar don't have any alert option. No notes to the watchlist. The customer support is very delayed and no one is interested in taking the feedback as well.",321,
2025-10-27 07:46:59,5,"A very user friendly app. Simple jobs for investors are way easily done. SIP monitor and the dashboard are great help and money handling through UPI and net banking is swift. There is a lag in the orders in MF closer to EOD as it may get in on the next day. Not used trading so cannot comment. One suggestion is that while scrolling list of stocks or MF, the current holding should show up below the relevant stock. it will assist comparisons one wishes to make.",314,
2025-09-26 14:12:11,1,"The app has been almost unusable for the past week. It constantly crashes with a ""Something went wrong"" message, and the persistent ""outdated data"" warning makes it impossible to trust the information shown. ​Your backend seems to be struggling with data fetching. This isn't a minor bug; it undermines the core function of a trading app. Please treat this with urgency. If the recent updates caused this, please consider reverting them. If this isn't resolved quickly, you will lose a customer.",300,

2025-09-12 13:57:50,1,"To start with the worst customer service experience I received, i could have shown you only there will be attachments available to drop off. I guess this is happening to everyone. I tried calling customer care but it was not connected even in 15 minutes, I tried to chat but the reply was so late that I got the reply on an average delay of 12 minutes sometimes even after half an hour and replies were poor too. Edited reply: I did never get the ticket ID but I have mailed you the issues.",273,
2025-10-08 12:35:25,4,"Nice app,clean UX. Statements downloads need password protection and pdf option. Also add portfolio view to see our sector-wise and watchlist-wise allocation. And, sector of company is not displayed if it has options chain. Better move sector details into 'About Company' section with more detail. And,managing list of alerts in one place is hard to find. Good to provide an edit icon where we open notifications from profile page.",269,
2025-11-09 10:07:27,4,"Everything is so so good about your app except one thing- it's speed is slow and sometimes it gets hanged, or the prices are not getting refreshed...This problem is persistent since the last 2-3 weeks...Or else full marks on everything else- it's super user- friendly, easy to use and trade!!",257,
2025-10-18 10:25:37,4,"I will give 5 star once this is sorted. Loved the app! However, I noticed that it doesn’t support the system default dark mode and only has a manual option. It would be great to have it follow the system theme automatically.",251,
2025-09-09 22:55:55,5,The trading experience on Groww has been very pleasant. Don't know if I will ever be able to use (or trust) any app after having used this app. One area where you guys could venture is the crypto market. Starting crypto with a trusted organization like Groww would be great for me and many others who don't know anything about that market.,228,
2025-10-14 10:46:44,1,"Worst app for stocks management..ditches you at the very moment of need. In stocks, time is money, and the app hangs right at the moment when u need quick actions. And its not just with me, or a one time event. Have heard it from many acquaintance, of multiple such events. It's a fundamental flaw in the app, that it freezes/hangs/orders not executed in opening hrs of market.",223,
2025-09-17 11:59:47,1,"There is no such thing as ""zero brokerage"" there are so many hidden brokerage and govt taxes which the app doesn't mention at all. it shows a negligible value for ex 0.004% but it's a scam, I buyed one stock of 220 ₹ normally exchange+taxes would be 1-2₹ extra but after a trade when I opened my contract note (full transaction history+ taxes+ their hidden brokerage values) I had to pay ₹5+ per share that's 3%+ !!!! it's a clear loot and scam of these guys to lure beginner traders.",220,
2025-10-20 15:54:18,1,"This App is worst, and lagging too much 😭😞, At time when I downloaded this app, this was my bestest choice, but now this is my worst choice, You know, when Iam click to exit profit, it simultaneously sold in loss, also you don't update chart patterns, if you update chart patterns, you don't update loss or profit, which coming in my portfolio, you know, this all problems is not only for f&o and intraday, This problems is for all stocks which is for buy and sell, And you removed oi system😭😞😡",215,
2025-09-11 15:36:55,1,bad app ... always payment settlement issue.. if your order is open in options then they will automatically reduce your buying price and make huge loss in next day.. I don't know how they did it with retailers... I have facing many losses due to app glitch issue.. they don't give me any refund.. so I deleted this app... worst experience.. they vanish my 1 lakh rupees although I have screenshot of my payment but they didn't gave me refund..,202,
2025-09-16 09:40:26,5,"Good is simple, handle is good. Just add the scalper mode and stop loss feature to this, then it will be a little easier to trade and the group app will remain at maximum number one. Please add this feature as soon as possible.🙏",192,

2025-11-12 14:57:35,4,"My experience is good on this app. I have just one suggestion - if you buy and sell the shares the same day and then again buy the same shares again the same day, the average price shown is average of all the trades. Instead of this average price shown, the new bought price should be reflected that will help to make decisions more precisely.",153,

2025-11-24 09:39:41,5,I seriously think opening an account with Groww was this easy. A clean and smooth UI and hassle free process - all up and running in half an hour. Even the app is so smooth and easy to navigate. Adding funds was also super smooth. Totally recommend it.,138,

2025-09-18 09:57:20,1,I was looking to import my MF portfolio into Groww. Initiated import but it has been stuck for 20+ minutes on the same page. I am curious as to how a reputable firm with an army of engineers can fail with this journey. Especially when the process gets stuck in a loop. I tried reaching out to support. But as usual Groww fails when it comes to human involvement. Reconsidering if moving the portfolio is even the right approach.,92,
2025-09-20 11:45:57,4,"Good app but I have a few suggestions regarding the UI: 1. The holdings/dashboard should be the first page that comes right ? Because the first thing a person wants to know is how all the investments are performing. At least give some functionality to tweak the UI based on one's needs. 2. Also there's just one widget that is related to stocks, what about MF ?",92,

## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 01, 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Feature Parity is the Top Demand:** The highest collective user impact (20,815) is driven by critical feature gaps, primarily the lack of a "Total Asset Tab" (Stocks + MFs combined) and the absence of the **GIFT Nifty Index**. This indicates that our core user base is increasingly looking for sophisticated portfolio management tools common among competitors.
*   **Operational Risk in Critical Workflows:** Technical instability, specifically app slowness and glitches during high-stakes moments like **IPO application submission**, is a recurring failure point (Impact Score: 11,115). This directly impacts user trust and necessitates an immediate engineering audit of the IPO gateway latency.
*   **Service Loop Failure:** While volume is lower, service issues (unanswered customer calls) combined with confusing brokerage charges are creating severe user frustration, prompting customers to recommend "going for another broker," posing a significant retention risk.

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Feature Parity for Advanced Users:** Immediately assign resources to the development and deployment of the **Total Combined Asset View** on the dashboard. Concurrently, fast-track the integration of the **GIFT Nifty Index** feed to satisfy power users and maintain feature competitiveness against major rivals.
2.  **Zero-Tolerance Policy for IPO Latency:** Initiate an immediate QA sprint dedicated solely to optimizing high-volume transaction processes. The friction reported in IPO application submission is unacceptable, potentially leading to financial losses or missed opportunities for users. Goal must be 100% reliable execution speed during peak traffic.
3.  **Audit Service Channels and Brokerage Clarity:** Conduct a deep dive into customer support response metrics, specifically call pickup rates, as users report "worst customer service." Simultaneously, review user-facing communication around brokerage calculation, ensuring transparency so users understand why "₹10–₹20 gets deducted" on small profits, mitigating perception of high fees.

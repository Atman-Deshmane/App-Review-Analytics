## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 01 Dec 2025 to 14 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
This reporting period, user feedback highlights a significant surge in "Other" themes, largely driven by feature requests, particularly for the Stochastic indicator. While "Trading Features" also shows strong user interest, "App Performance Issues" remain a critical concern, with a high-impact quote detailing substantial slippage in intraday trading.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

*   **Other (Impact Score: 12966, Review Count: 173):** This theme dominates user feedback, indicating a strong desire for enhanced functionality. The high impact score is significantly influenced by feature requests, notably for the Stochastic indicator, suggesting a keen interest from users in advanced charting tools.
*   **Trading Features (Impact Score: 6591, Review Count: 38):** While fewer in review count than "Other," "Trading Features" carries a substantial impact score, primarily driven by a highly-voted feature request. This underscores the importance users place on specific trading tools and improvements within the app.
*   **App Performance Issues (Impact Score: 413, Review Count: 49):** Despite a lower impact score compared to "Other" and "Trading Features," the "App Performance Issues" theme is critical due to the severity of reported problems. A specific instance of high slippage in intraday trading has led to a user considering a switch to a competitor, highlighting a significant risk to user retention.

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   **"please add stochastic indicator, which is very useful, when you are going to add stochastic indicator?? Please update" (Votes: 5729)** - This quote perfectly encapsulates the overwhelming user demand within the "Other" and "Trading Features" themes, emphasizing a clear desire for advanced technical analysis tools.
*   **"Have been using this app for some time now. Good for mutual funds, delivery and all. But when I started intraday trading, i encountered its high slippage. For example, I book a trade at a profit of around 12000 using their exit button, the executed amount would be 10000. There have been times when booked a profit of more than 2000 still the executed profit was not only less but in loss -749. This is higly disappointing. Now I'm looking for a new broker app." (Votes: 197)** - This quote provides a stark example of the detrimental impact of "App Performance Issues," directly leading to user dissatisfaction and churn risk, particularly for active traders.
*   **"I like using the Groww app, but I have one major issue. The charges that get deducted are not clearly explained. When any amount is charged, there are no proper details or breakdown provided. It becomes confusing to understand why the charges were applied. Please improve the transparency of charges and provide clear details so users can track everything easily. Otherwise, the app experience is good, but this issue needs to be fixed." (Votes: 192)** - This quote highlights a significant gap in user understanding and trust related to "Charges and Fees." Lack of transparency can erode user confidence, even in an otherwise positive experience.

### 3. Recommended Actions

*   **Prioritize and Roadmap Feature Requests:** Expedite the investigation and potential implementation of high-demand features like the Stochastic indicator to address the significant user interest in "Other" and "Trading Features."
*   **Investigate and Mitigate Intraday Trading Slippage:** Conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the reported high slippage for intraday trading. Implement necessary technical fixes to ensure accurate trade execution and prevent user churn.
*   **Enhance Transparency in Charges and Fees:** Review and update the app's interface and backend to provide clearer, more detailed breakdowns of all charges and fees. Consider implementing tooltips or dedicated information sections to improve user comprehension.

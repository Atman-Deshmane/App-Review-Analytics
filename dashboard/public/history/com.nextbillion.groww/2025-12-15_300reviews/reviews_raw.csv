2025-12-03 17:43:03,5,it's been 1.5 years I am using groww. However since then till now they have improved a lot. They have improved their UI which is very easy for beginners. I prefer this app over any other investment apps coz of it's simple UI. I have invested in stocks and mutual fund through this app as the steps were very easy. A beginner can easily understand how to use this app and even portfolio tracking is also very easy using this app.,3597,
2025-12-09 11:48:09,5,"It's been a while I'm using this platform for my investment specially for buying stocks and SIP investment, this charts are very easy to consume, I would recommend this app for everyone, it's an effortless thing to do.",3438,
2025-12-11 13:01:49,4,one suggestion regarding alerts .... users must be able to keep alerts for 1 year as your peer - zerodha has the same feature and going 1 step forward a order can be placed once the price touch that trigger price / target price if we have sufficient amt in the wallet... and 2nd - news section regarding a particular stock is not up to the mark... otherwise fantastic app - that's why I have cut 1 star....🙏🙏,484,
2025-12-11 12:03:49,2,"Groww charts are very basic and the team is not releasing any updates at all. No features like a traders diary, multiple watchlists, order tabs are creating confusion. Events calendar don't have any alert option. No notes to the watchlist. The customer support is very delayed and no one is interested in taking the feedback as well. no updates to groww charts from 3.5 months, groww team is not responding on this at all.",323,
2025-12-07 07:45:55,1,"Have been using this app for some time now. Good for mutual funds, delivery and all. But when I started intraday trading, i encountered its high slippage. For example, I book a trade at a profit of around 12000 using their exit button, the executed amount would be 10000. There have been times when booked a profit of more than 2000 still the executed profit was not only less but in loss -749. This is higly disappointing. Now I'm looking for a new broker app.",197,
2025-12-12 04:03:04,4,"I like using the Groww app, but I have one major issue. The charges that get deducted are not clearly explained. When any amount is charged, there are no proper details or breakdown provided. It becomes confusing to understand why the charges were applied. Please improve the transparency of charges and provide clear details so users can track everything easily. Otherwise, the app experience is good, but this issue needs to be fixed.",192,
2025-12-05 09:03:46,1,"Absolutely Unacceptable Technical Failures During Trading ​I am writing this review out of extreme frustration and disappointment with the Groww app, specifically regarding its stability during critical trading moments. ​This app is fundamentally unreliable when you need it most. I recently experienced multiple instances of the app crashing and freezing while attempting to execute time-sensitive trades. Imagine trying to book profit or cut losses, only for the entire application to close.",127,
2025-12-03 05:19:04,5,"the best app for investing. I love the interface and the evolutionary journey of groww makes me feel proud. They have brought changes step by step to make sure that customers cope up with the tech and small tips and tricks here and there is what I like the most, for example it shows the % change in stock price from the day I added that stock into my watchlist and many more",75,
2025-12-04 03:55:42,2,I like the simplicity of the app but the dashboard seems messy if we have multiple funds of different categories. there is no way to group or see funds under certain categories.,68,
2025-12-03 10:33:27,1,"Useless, Suspicious, pretentious, irresponsible activities are being done by it's staff members. WhyCYBERCRIME.GOV.IN, SEBI, CONSUMER COURT, eDAAKHILA.GOV.IN are there ? Worst, irresponsible customer support personnels. Is Groww a SCAM ! Very very unpleasant experiences. Some staff members are leaking investors personal sensitive data, why ? In this way, Groww is going to loose it's authenticity & goodwill very soon. Why appointing such staff who're harrassing thy customers ? Is GROWW a FRAUD !!",43,
2025-12-05 09:06:02,1,"This is a good app but crashes frequently. Many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses. Please resolve this issue.",35,

2025-12-05 04:52:48,1,"Although it's a big company now, the app still behaves like those startups that do borderline scamming practices that aren't legal, but aren't confidence inducing as well. for eg, how it misdirects people into creating a groww upi account while adding money to the app. at least it can be easily disabled after being creating, but it causes confusion and wastes time",20,

2025-12-02 12:56:50,1,"Terrible app for swing traders. They show good profits while trading, but after order execution they cut massive hidden charges and deductions.

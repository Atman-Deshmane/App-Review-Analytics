**Reporting Period:** 07 Jan 2026 to 18 Jan 2026

### Executive Summary
App Usability continues to be the dominant theme, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback and driving significant user satisfaction. While Trading Features are generally well-received, specific feature requests indicate an opportunity for enhancement, particularly for novice investors. Customer Support, however, remains a critical area needing immediate attention due to severe negative sentiment.

## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 15 Dec 2025 to 28 Dec 2025

### Executive Summary
App performance remains the dominant concern, with a significant number of users highlighting a lack of updates and basic feature limitations, particularly around charting and trading tools. While trading features are generally well-received, there's a clear demand for enhancements like advanced charting, improved alert management, and additional investment options. Customer support continues to be a pain point, with frequent complaints about unresponsiveness and abrupt chat closures.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

*   **App Performance (Impact Score: 1014, Reviews: 109):** This theme continues to be the most critical area for improvement. The overwhelmingly negative sentiment stems from the perceived stagnation of the app, with users explicitly mentioning a lack of updates to core features like charts and a desire for advanced trading functionalities such as a trader's diary and multiple watchlists. The absence of essential features like chart alerts and notes on watchlists further compounds user frustration.
*   **Trading Features (Impact Score: 922, Reviews: 68):** While the core UX is appreciated, users are requesting specific feature additions that would significantly enhance their trading experience. The desire for features like LRS for foreign MF investments, better display of sector information, and more robust stock price alert management indicates a segment of users looking for Groww to cater to more sophisticated trading needs.
*   **Customer Support (Impact Score: 123, Reviews: 36):** Despite a lower review count than other themes, the impact score and the qualitative feedback reveal a significant issue. Users are experiencing extreme unresponsiveness and a perceived lack of genuine interest in resolving their issues. The abrupt closure of chats without confirmation of resolution is particularly damaging to user satisfaction and trust.

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   "Groww charts are very basic and the team is not releasing any updates at all. No features like a traders diary, multiple watchlists, order tabs are creating confusion. Events calendar don't have any alert option. No notes to the watchlist. The customer support is very delayed and no one is interested in taking the feedback as well. no updates to groww charts from 3.5 months, groww team is not responding on this at all. Your what's new section writings contain more creativity than your platforms." - **(Illustrates critical App Performance issues and perceived lack of responsiveness.)**
*   "Nice app,clean UX.Will be nice to add LRS for investments in foreign MF. And, sector of company is not displayed if it has options chain. Better move sector details into 'About Company' section. And, managing list of stock price alerts in one place is hard to find. Good to provide an edit alerts icon where we open notifications from profile page." - **(Highlights specific, actionable requests for Trading Feature enhancements.)**
*   "I am not sure why, but Groww’s customer support executives are extremely unresponsive. They appear to be in a hurry to close the chat and often end the conversation on their own without confirming whether the issue has been resolved. After the first query is submitted, there is no opportunity to ask follow-up questions or seek clarification on the solution they provide. Whether the response is understood or helpful seems irrelevant, as the chat is abruptly closed." - **(Emphasizes the severe negative impact of Customer Support deficiencies.)**

**Reporting Period:** 22 Dec 2025 to 04 Jan 2026

### Executive Summary

This period sees a significant surge in negative sentiment, particularly around "Trading Features" and "App Performance Issues," driven by user frustration with charting capabilities and overall app glitches. While "Other" continues to generate positive reviews, the escalating concerns in core functionality threaten user retention.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

*   **Trading Features (Impact Score: 1032, Review Count: 23):** This remains the dominant theme, with users expressing strong dissatisfaction regarding the lack of updates and essential trading tools such as a trader's diary, multiple watchlists, and effective alert options. The sentiment indicates a growing gap between user expectations for a robust trading platform and Groww's current offerings.
*   **App Performance Issues (Impact Score: 277, Review Count: 25):** The impact score for this theme has escalated, directly correlating with user complaints about frequent glitches, inability to view holdings, and poor charting performance (zoom functionality). This is a critical area impacting user experience and potentially driving churn, as evidenced by a user's threat to switch apps.
*   **Customer Support (Impact Score: 97, Review Count: 10):** While the review count is lower, the impact score combined with user feedback highlights significant issues with responsiveness and the perceived haste to close support chats.

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   **"Groww charts are very basic and the team is not releasing any updates at all. No features like a traders diary, multiple watchlists, order tabs are creating confusion. Events calendar don't have any alert option. No notes to the watchlist. The customer support is very delayed and no one is interested in taking the feedback as well. no updates to groww charts from 3.5 months, groww team is not responding on this at all. Your what's new section writings contain more creativity than your platforms." (Votes: 412)** - This quote encapsulates the core issues around outdated trading features and a perceived lack of developer engagement, highlighting a direct link between feature stagnation and user frustration.
*   **"taking so much charges in every trade...still so much glitches are there...sometimes you won't able to see your holding postions...charts are so much pathetic...you cannot able to zoom out the chart properly for analysing...please fix this all then take so much charges.. I will just use it for 2-3 months more if there is no changes or improvement I will shift to another app..if you can't improve your app, you should take low charges.." (Votes: 83)** - This quote powerfully connects perceived high charges with underlying app performance and feature deficiencies, indicating a critical need for immediate improvement to justify costs and retain users.
*   **"I am not sure why, but Groww’s customer support executives are extremely unresponsive. They appear to be in a hurry to close the chat and often end the conversation on their own without confirming whether the issue has been resolved. After the first query is submitted, there is no opportunity to ask follow-up questions or seek clarification on the solution they provide. Whether the response is understood or helpful seems irrelevant, as the chat is abruptly closed." (Votes: 39)** - This quote directly addresses the critical shortcomings in customer support, revealing a systemic issue with agent training and process that is negatively impacting user problem resolution and overall satisfaction.

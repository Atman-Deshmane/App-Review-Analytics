The UI is clean, and it's beginner-friendly. However, one feature that could take it to the next level would be stock recommendations for both long-term investments and short-term trades (like swing trading). It would be super helpful to get insights, expert analysis, or even curated stock lists based on different time horizons and risk appetites.",2353,
2025-09-19 11:41:58,4,"This is one of the best platforms for investment, but applying for an IPO is frustrating. Recently, the application process gets stuck on ""sending application to exchange,"" failing to generate a number or send a mandate. Other platforms like AngelOne and INDmoney are much faster. But I prefer using Groww, so I often have to cancel and reapply to get my application submitted, which is especially stressful on the final day.",2009,
2025-11-02 16:08:18,5,"Super impressed! The documentation process was incredibly quick and effortless. All my mutual funds were auto-loaded from the central repository, requiring zero manual effort. The best part was that it even retrieved some of my old mutual funds that I no longer had records of. I also raised a redemption request, which was processed swiftly. If the payout is completed within the estimated timeline, this would be an outstanding overall experience.",1522,
2025-11-09 19:36:29,5,"Couple of issues that can be addressed. Many brokers allow the details of the trades along with the charges to be downloaded in the Excel format for uploading the data to another Excel sheet maintained by them. Groww needs to work on this aspect. 2. when I transact, the rate given on the screen is seemed to be higher than prevailing rate if a buy is being placed and similar for a sell transaction. I would like a situation where the rate on the screen is blank and filled by the trader.",1040,
2025-10-06 00:54:24,5,"Best experience 👌 overall! But I faced one issue — I bought 3 stocks and tried paying via Fampay UPI but the payment didn’t go through. Also, the brokerage charges feel a bit high — even when I get ₹2–₹3 profit, ₹10–₹20 gets deducted, which is frustrating. Please fix this issue, otherwise Groww is really one of the best and most user-friendly trading apps! 🔥",884,
2025-10-03 09:27:58,1,"I regret choosing this platform. While the user interface looks polished and onboarding was smooth, the app fails spectacularly at the absolute most critical time for any trader: market opening. Every single morning, without fail, as the clock hits 9:15 AM (or within the first five crucial minutes), the servers completely seize up. The app becomes unresponsive, trades won't execute, and worst of all, I can't exit positions. This isn't a minor glitch; it is a fundamental flaw",701,
2025-11-12 22:41:06,1,Really disappointed been using the app from almost 8 months initially the app was very good but now its buggy like hell every other day cannot place orders. When placing order in intraday it place order really late and sometimes even after 20 mins order pending and when the place the order already miss on profits. Even today market is open from 15 mins and still can't place new orders really getting in my nerves now. If you guys keep on going like this wont take long for people to move to others,688,
2025-10-23 13:36:22,1,"The app is becoming worse day by day. I have seen too many glitches in the recent days, sometimes wallet balance is incorrect, sometimes login doesn't work, sometimes you can't make payments etc etc. With every glitch, my trust is eroding from this app. Update (23 Oct 2025) - I don't think they are able to handle the volume of transactions happening on their platform. Glitches still occur and now happen repeatedly. Price alerts for ETFs do not work at all.",668,
2025-09-18 21:01:13,1,#Go for another broker. This app has been giving a lot of issues. It is not working well in the commodity section. While putting buy/sell orders in options the executed orders don't appear immediately in the positions . it takes a lot of time. Very slow app. The interface was not this bad earlier. Bugs may be there too. The Worst customer service. Calls are not picked up.,649,
2025-10-16 12:23:38,1,"I'm very disappointed with this app. Used to like this app because of it's super fast order placements and simple UI. but on 14th October, I was placing my order to sell shares of LG at 50% but due to some error I wasn't able to sell. I tried 4 times but it failed. After 15minutes, I did sell the shares but at less profit at 44%. Hence I was able to book less profit. If such problem continues I may suffer a huge loss in the future. that's why I don't want to use this app anymore.",577,
2025-10-15 05:27:15,1,"This is the worst platform for trading and investing, especially for beginners. They bail out on you at the very crucial moment. I have been trying to sell my share from yesterday, either app crashes during procedures or even after completing all procedures my order is not placed. It's just not that even during the purchase app crashes like it's deliberately doesn't want you to make profit. I'm so much disappointed.",476,
2025-09-20 13:49:56,1,"For the past few days, I’ve been unable to open the app and keep getting the error “OOPS, SOMETHING WENT WRONG.” I updated the app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it. After logging in, it worked fine the day before yesterday, but now I’m facing the same error again when opening the app. My internet bandwidth is good, so I’m not sure why the app is behaving like this.",386,
2025-09-27 11:31:29,1,"Heard about it from a friend. But had to immediately uninstalled. At initial setup, it's too easy to accidentally choose some options. You can't go back and correct the choices. And these can not be changed later in settings as well. Also it's terrible at account deletion. Once in, it's a nightmare to exit. Do not get into the trap!",341,
2025-10-14 10:46:44,1,"Worst app for stocks management..ditches you at the very moment of need. In stocks, time is money, and the app hangs right at the moment when u need quick actions. And its not just with me, or a one time event. Have heard it from many acquaintance, of multiple such events. It's a fundamental flaw in the app, that it freezes/hangs/orders not executed in opening hrs of market.",225,
2025-11-28 01:32:38,4,"Very good app,though there is one limitation, that is a 10 year section not available for mutual funds when sorting or viewing any individual funds chart,it is important since it gives more long term perspective,and I would suggest for it to be added.And currently very few bonds available.",180,
2025-11-13 15:56:25,1,"I have faced an issue while converting my intraday to delivery. The application said you have sufficient balance but there is an error for the conversion. I couldn't convert and they deducted the roundoff money. I have contacted the costomer care but they said, I didn't have sufficient money for the convertion. that is, we need to pay for their errors too. I had screenshots but no reply, nothing....",174,
2025-11-22 20:05:42,1,"only good for long time for others it is worst app.. i lost alot of money by using this app.. some time refreshing some time not exicute etc.. many problems are there in this app.. and you see more profit on your PL, But when you exit it it will less than the first amount and when you see the loss amount on your PL when exit it the loss amout is more than when you see first... if you put a target number the target will hit only the target number cross above not will hit even reach the target.",98,
2025-11-19 10:39:17,1,third class customer support. I have opened my account well in advance for applying for ipo. bank account verified. for trial I did transaction buyed and sold to understand app so that in the end I don't get confused. but after successful allotment at the end time I came to know bank not verified do I can't sell. no Customer support. they only chat after 15 min and the answer is we don't have details. now who is responsible for loss? I am using paytm money since 4 years never had such problem.,74,
2025-11-29 13:49:49,5,it's all good.... pls avail the SL and Target trailing on the chart itself.. coz whenever I go in profit I need to trail the SL n target... and it's very irritating to go through the whole process to be done in a manual way. so pls add that feature.. I need all the features on the chart either it's sl target or dispose the position. it would be a good relief. pls look into this .,46,
2025-11-29 12:42:17,2,"The app is good, but the call center experience isn’t. I prefer your AI Voice Assistant because it solves my problem in just 30–50 seconds. In a human call, I first have to enter my date of birth, then select options based on my issue, and only after that do I get connected to a representative. The whole process takes around 7–8 minutes. The speed should be faster. In the end, my problem was solved. Thank you.",22,
2025-11-28 23:06:31,1,"Too late response in option trading.. Even after setting the stop loss at a particular price, it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss. And on top of that the hidden charges ..Resulting P&L shows different after the day and when the amount reflects it is always lower and then unnecessary deductions. There is always 200-500 rs difference than what actually should have been received deducted in the name of charges other than execution charges.",10,
2025-11-27 14:24:37,1,Why trade value of stock is not added in mobile application as it is present in desktop version even though their is proper space for that. I would like to request to add that small feature in mobile version so that I could change my rating. I'm not asking for much technical features I just want a feature which is already present in Groww. Hope this would be helpful for other users as well. I would be waiting for your response.,7,
2025-11-29 15:31:43,2,"The brokerage rates are attractive, but the app has usability issues, instead if showing the dashboard after login, the app shows explore, in MF section, the executed orders do not show buying NAV rate and Units allocated. in Stocks there are more problems which cannot be written due to words limits.",5,
2025-11-27 14:34:16,4,"Showing events in single place is a great update. One suggestion, it would be nice to be able add & edit notes in MF/SIP, since everyone might have a reason for joining each SIP. Also, along with 52 week prof, dividend would be a good reference.",3,
2025-11-30 11:05:58,5,this option chain is not better..so please give old option chain with change in oi and total oi.. there is no proper dispay in new option chain..so please change it.

2026-02-03 12:43:31,1,"There's no option to increase the font size. Even after increasing the device font, still its too small. It's so uncomfortable to read . Further to go on the main detailed chart page. We had to go through and click at least 2-3 links. Then there's no option to save chart settings. No facility to trade currency derivatives also. This mobile app is not user and trader friendly. 03/02/26: I was expecting that company will respond to the review/concern/feedback. BIG SHOCKER. 😱",408,
2026-01-28 16:03:57,5,l liked the app. The UI and interface feels smooth and snappy. One thing I noticed is that my total returns was negative but my 1 day return was showing a positive value on the first day of buying a stock which is somewhat confusing.,237,

2026-01-31 12:11:13,4,Sometimes the price of stocks are showing wrong. But to be honest groww has a very much user friendly UI than any other.,78,
2026-01-29 04:32:06,5,I would recommend this app to everyone. t Trading is your responsibility but the app provides you with the simplest and most insightful analysis and user interface.,76,
2026-01-31 10:43:26,5,really nice app for trading and sips. You can also get lot of information about market by lots of charts and nice representation of information.,75,
2026-01-28 06:52:08,5,updated version of Groww is one of the finest version of brokerage app for every segment of share market trading... trading assessment graf before trading is much helpful for a trader..... and many more options are there......,75,
2026-01-29 11:23:41,5,"So far I have had a great & smooth experience on Groww, Have been using this app for I guess 1.5 to 2 years (Only for Mutual funds - SIP & Equity - Stocks) haven't really tried Intra day not a fan of it honestly.",73,
2026-01-30 08:28:31,2,"In this app, I often face technical errors when trying to exit the market, and because I’m unable to exit on time, I end up incurring losses. I also have screenshots of the technical error, but there is no option to attach them here. otherwise, I would have attached them.",72,
2026-02-04 05:31:12,5,"Groww is one of the best investment apps I’ve used. The interface is very simple and beginner-friendly, even for someone new to stocks and mutual funds. Account opening was smooth, transactions are fast, and portfolio tracking is very clear. I like how everything is explained in an easy way without confusion. Overall, a reliable platform for long-term investing. Highly recommended!",56,
2026-02-02 02:51:39,5,"“All the available services are very good and easy to understand, but there is no option to buy U.S. stocks. If that option were also added, it would be even better. It would be great to have all services in one place within the app.”",52,
2026-02-02 09:00:20,1,"2 issues with the app I am noticing lately 1. I was just checking how SIP works, and it immediately read the OTP from sms and booked the order, even though it was booked for future date I wasn't able to cancel it. 2. I accidentally clicked the F&O tab and then suddenly I clicked the activate button, there is no way to go back or deactivate it. Both of them are the cases of User experience manipulation. This should be avoided.",51,
2026-02-04 04:23:54,5,"Groww is my first broker for conducting and managing investments. The UI is extremely intuitive for both Stocks and Mutual Funds, especially for beginners. Features like stock SIPs, price alerts for stocks of interest, related news, technical and foundational analyses, SIP update support for Mutual Funds help a lot. The brokerage fees is reasonably low. One enhancement suggestion is adding the same SIP update options as Mutual Funds, for stocks too. Very satisfied so far. Great job!",43,
2026-02-01 04:08:29,1,One of the worst customer support I've ever encountered. Support agents won't connect on time and close conversation without solving queries. It's been two days I am trying to solve problems with my account but I'm getting no help. Finally I've decided to close my account completely.,39,
2026-02-01 02:50:58,3,"App is good, however some improvements. Nominee name entry has letter limit and hence cannot add full name as per a valid document.

2026-02-04 02:53:58,1,"Faced serious execution issues on Groww during intraday trading. When the stock price jumped and was clearly in profit the moment I clicked Exit the executed price dropped sharply turning it into a huge loss. To verify, I re-entered the same stock and placed a target at a very high price. The price visibly touched that level within seconds yet the order executed below my buy price again resulting in a huge loss. This happened multiple times. Clear mismatch between price shown and price executed",24,
2026-02-05 02:43:38,2,"I have been using the app for last 3 years. I am happy except one thing. I can not sort my GTT orders based some criteria like buy, sell, alphabetical, order price close to market price. I requested groww to enhance their app with these features to help customers make quick decisions. But no use, Groww does not understand customer needs. i have been waiting for this update since 2+years. is it so difficult, I can do it in two days, give me the source code. or you are not interested to do.",17,
2026-01-28 16:29:24,2,"I use 3 apps Groww, Zerodha Kite & Angel One. Groww is the most simple and easiest to use. For those who simply want to buy and sell after taking advice from others will enjoy Groww. In simple words Groww is for children above 18 years 😂. I am sorry to say but when I use this app I get very irritated because apart from buying and selling I have to refer to Zerodha and Angel One for other information. Some features are much better on Groww but still can't beat the other 2. Chart is horrible.",17,
2026-01-30 07:11:23,1,"worst customer support system, 10 minutes are minimum when you call on their customer care no., after that the executives are completely morons, No call transfer system to concerned department.

2026-02-02 03:56:16,1,price of a stock was 220 Rs. And previous day price was 263 Rs. when I was selling the stock then it said I have to place order above 263 but price was 220.

Buy orders placed at ₹99 get executed near ₹102. Stop loss at ₹80 hits at ₹77, and targets at ₹125 hit at ₹123. These small differences ruin trading over time.

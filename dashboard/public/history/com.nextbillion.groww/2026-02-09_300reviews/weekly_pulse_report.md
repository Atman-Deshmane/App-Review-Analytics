## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** 26 Jan 2026 to 08 Feb 2026

### Executive Summary
This reporting period saw a continued strong focus on User Interface, though with a notable concern regarding font size and navigation. App Performance also remains a significant area of feedback, with a user experiencing confusion around return calculations. The addition of U.S. stock trading emerged as a highly desired feature within the "Other" category.

### 1. Top Themes & Strategic Insights

*   **User Interface (UI):** This theme continues to dominate user feedback, with a significant impact score (1159) and a substantial number of reviews (77). While generally perceived as smooth, critical issues like the inability to increase font size and cumbersome navigation to detailed charts are hindering user experience and trader-friendliness. The lack of response to user feedback is also a growing concern.
*   **App Performance:** With an impact score of 701 and 50 reviews, App Performance is the second most impactful theme. While some users find the app snappy, there are specific instances of confusing data presentation, such as conflicting daily and total return figures on the day of a stock purchase.
*   **Other:** This broad category, despite having the highest review count (131), has a lower impact score (62). However, a significant insight here is the strong user demand for the inclusion of U.S. stock trading, indicating a potential opportunity for market expansion and increased user engagement.

### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   **User Interface:** "There's no option to increase the font size. Even after increasing the device font, still its too small. It's so uncomfortable to read . Further to go on the main detailed chart page. We had to go through and click at least 2-3 links. Then there's no option to save chart settings. No facility to trade currency derivatives also. This mobile app is not user and trader friendly. 03/02/26: I was expecting that company will respond to the review/concern/feedback. BIG SHOCKER. 😱"
*   **App Performance:** "l liked the app. The UI and interface feels smooth and snappy. One thing I noticed is that my total returns was negative but my 1 day return was showing a positive value on the first day of buying a stock which is somewhat confusing."
*   **Other:** “All the available services are very good and easy to understand, but there is no option to buy U.S. stocks. If that option were also added, it would be even better. It would be great to have all services in one place within the app.”

### 3. Recommended Actions

*   **Prioritize UI Enhancements:** Address the critical UI issues of font size adjustability and streamline navigation to key features like detailed charts. Implement a robust system for responding to user feedback and reviews to demonstrate responsiveness.
*   **Investigate Return Calculation Clarity:** Review and refine the display of investment returns, particularly the daily vs. total return figures on the day of a stock purchase, to eliminate user confusion.
*   **Explore U.S. Stock Trading Integration:** Conduct a feasibility study and market analysis for integrating U.S. stock trading into the Groww platform, given the expressed user demand.

*   "Opening a demat account with Groww was incredibly simple and fully digital. I didn’t need to fill any paperwork or visit a branch. The app guided me through each step seamlessly. It’s great for anyone new to investing. Within minutes, I was ready to buy and sell the stocks. I appreciate how user-friendly the process was—Groww made it completely hassle-free and beginner-friendly." (Easy Account Opening)
*   "I called related to this issue but I'm not satisfied. I'd like to go legally for this, is there anything that could be done before that? I emailed screenshot for reference how it glitched moving up and down in very short duration eating away my profit from 55k brought it to 5k, likely by operator. On US gold futures I don't see this glitch hence it's a blatant lie that charts are loaded externally. Also they lied about app not being upto date, attached same in email. Try fix the profit atleast." (App Performance Issues)
*   "I request everyone to use a different app.. because this apps customer support is completely unusable.. they don't receive call and if they receive by any chance they just cut the call after listening your problem and on chat they do the same.. reaching them takes 2 or 3 hours.. and if can reach they just closed the chat or cut the call... rubbish" (Customer Support)

Also, it would be great if you keep the ""Disappearing Messages"" customisable for both the parties. One should be able to keep the feature off for themselves while the other one keeps it on for him/her and vice versa. Also the duration for the same should be customisable as per preference",248980,

Me and thousands more are getting crazy on the Internet, there is no way to solve it!!!! I have had my phone on vibrate for many years, no joke, I haven't had the sound activated in years, and it still makes sounds. even if I put it in silence mode where everything is muted, it still makes these sounds!! conversation tones are off and the app still makes the sounds!!",160474,
2025-10-06 15:19:04,3,"WhatsApp is by far the best messaging app. The only issues are: 1) we can no longer tell when audios are heard by receiver (not sure if theme color affects, but this is a big deal) 2) Info and copy options r in a menu instead of shortcut button at top (along w/reply etc), even though there's still space for it. Makes it inconvenient considering how often those features r used. 3) It would b MUCH better if the read/played time was a timestamp, instead of how long ago, so we don't have to the math",86586,

Before, it took only one time data to download something and forwarding didn't require much data. But now a days if you download something, then it takes a lot of time and data, also it doesn't get forwarded easily, when you try to do so, the media is downloaded again and takes up too much time. It's really irritating.",83327,

I was wondering if you can make it able for us to search for music with the artist and song name at the same time because when I search for a song it's hard to find it because a lot of songs have a similar name or when I'm searching for an artist but can't find the song because they have too many songs. please improve it.",22231,

2025-10-03 09:57:34,1,"The new motion photo feature is awful. It now defaults to sending your photos as a motion photo, which is the default for how a lot of phones take picture. Occasionally this might be useful, but 90% of the time it's just going to send the motion of you trying to send the picture and you're not going to remember to switch it off every single time. Should be off by default unless you actively want to send a motion photo which I suspect will be rare, or at least have a setting to choose that.",16274,

There is only a notification saying, ""you may have new messages"" and then when we open the app, all the messages are received then with their original time stamps when they were actually sent. Also, sending messages is also taking way too much time and the sender only sees a single tick even when you are online in the app. This is causing too many problems.",15786,

That is weird because I used to be able to do this quite flawlessly, and I have not changed my device. and voice notes work great in chats, so why can't I send them as replies to statuses now. And now, you have removed the emoji Keyboard when uploading statuses? Why? With every update, you needlessly take something great away.",14919,

While I've always thought it couldn't get any better, the status 'reshare' button is a game changer, but PLEASE! anyone whose button isn't on shouldn't be able to reshare others' post who have turned theirs on. I'm not being petty😂 but people tend to attach insignificant meaning to things. It would be nice also if we could edit animated stickers also. Editing them now, only allows the stickers as images.🙃",10594,

My issue is the new song feature, why give it to us when you're not going to make it work well. You can't find the original songs, mostly covers and sometimes you select a song to add to a picture you want to post and it refuses to send until you remove the song. it's frustrating. make the song feature like the one on Instagram",7773,

Accidentally saved contacts into 'whatsapp's seperate contact list' which has been introduced for whatever reason, rather than in your phone? good luck deleting that as their own 'help' page is useless. it is turning into a social media website which will benefit from their user's data like other meta products rather than being a simple messaging app.",5798,

Other than that, meh app.",5781,

2025-10-19 22:26:44,4,"This app is a great one, no problem so far until now. Anytime I send a video it keeps cutting the size of that video in half. For example; if I send a video that consists of a full body, when the receiver gets it, it plays with only the lower body (I have tested it with multiple phones so the fault is not from the receiver). It hasn't been doing that before but it started all of a sudden. I've cleared some space on my phone and also updated the app but still no change. Dev help please. Thanks.",5146,
2025-11-30 02:53:41,4,"I have a request/suggestion to Admin team. Please add a built in “Translate to English” option for messages in WhatsApp, similar to YouTube’s comment section. Many of my friends are from different nationalities, so I often receive messages in various languages. It would be very helpful if I could translate them instantly with just one tap instead of doing it manually every time.This feature would make communication much easier for users like me.",5099,

But until recently my account has been repeatedly suspended and unsuspended, and it's getting really frustrating. Their system keeps disclaiming that it's being suspended due to spam but all I do is jus text as normal, replying messages, and they suspend it again. isn't there a problem somewhat with the system? I'm probably not the only one experiencing this so let it be addressed please.",4704,

2025-09-19 02:50:54,5,"Honestly, WhatsApp has become pretty indispensable for me. It's the go-to app for keeping in touch with almost everyone – family abroad, local friends, even work groups. The fact that it's free, reliable for calls and messages, and lets me share photos and documents so easily makes it incredibly convenient. I especially appreciate the group chat feature for planning things or just staying updated with multiple people at once, and the voice notes are a lifesaver when I'm on the go.",4316,
2025-09-19 00:32:23,1,"please stop making unnecessary changes to the UI... we don't have access to all folders anymore when we want to send media, and we can only do so when we send them through documents, and that is so unnecessarily inconvenient. it might seem small, but for a messaging app where people may want to send a lot of pictures to people, this is a big thing. the users' comfort should be your main priority, not making the UI look 'good.' we shouldn't be needing extra steps to access some features.",3707,
2025-09-28 13:55:47,2,"The app is good when it comes to messaging. But instead of all these irrelevant updates that serves no useful purposes, please work on maintaining the quality of media posted on status. It's annoying when you post a good quality picture or video and it's reduced drastically to a blur when I post it on my status. Also, please remove the mention group option. It's annoying. I don't want to be forced to see a triggering status by someone I don't even know.",3625,
2025-09-30 05:09:15,5,"WhatsApp is great for what it does. It's easy to message, call and voice note. I've personally never had a problem with it. It's not meant to be like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. It's in its own little box. it's great when you're abroad and there's WiFi so you can contact friends or loved ones whether biological or not. It's simple and easy to use.",3598,
2025-11-20 12:48:23,4,"Although I love whatsapp, as of late, I am experiencing that back ups are taking forever where they used to be speedy. Would love to know why. Another reviewer also posted about the access to the gallery when sending videos and images. One doesn't have access to the full gallery as we used to - but it seems the latest update fixed that. I hope it stays that way.",3525,
2025-09-12 12:23:15,5,"WhatsApp is an app I use daily as I have a lot of people I need to contact without consuming my data. Recently it's updates have been amazing especially with the dark mode, finally. My only suggestion is the compression and rescaling of media. When we're on WiFi, can we have an option to toggle that off to increase the quality of our media, such as photos and videos? Edit: They actually listened. Very cool.",3102,
2025-11-09 06:06:24,5,"Everyone knows nothing can beat Meta WhatsApp; this is the best messaging app! But I'd love it if they added a feature where users can create sounds for Status updates and add sounds to favourites from other users - that would be awesome! and also I love the new reshare button on WhatsApp! It's super convenient. However, it would be great if you could see the person who originally posted it or their number, especially for business-related shares. This could help with networking and follow-ups.",3008,
2025-10-14 21:28:27,3,"I can't seem to respond to people's status via voice note. I would record a whole message and click the send button. It would read ""sending"" but when I go to the chats there is no voice note. New issues every single time. Also, consider the quality of media when we're uploading statuses. Enable an HD option for that as well please. How can I have an HD option when I send media to contacts but I can't have it for my status?",2791,
2025-09-18 00:08:48,3,"WhatsApp is an excellent app and I really appreciate how dependable it has been for staying connected. However, I’ve noticed a consistent problem: whenever my unread messages reach close to 70, all of them automatically get marked as “read” even though I haven’t opened them. I’ve checked my linked devices and security settings, so it seems to be a bug in the app. I hope the team can investigate and fix this in a future update.",2783,
2025-11-14 19:12:29,1,"I'm using a OnePlus 7T and noticed two WhatsApp issues: When selecting multiple media files(even 2), there's no ""Share"" option, only ""Forward,"" making it very hard to share with external apps. Also, when I long-press a text message ""Copy"" option appears, but not for images, making it very hard to copy images from chats. Please fix these problems to improve usability.",2677,
2025-11-20 15:23:58,5,"very exceptional, but kindly update the AI features to be strong so we don't have to be using other AI apps. overall, the up is soo good.

In addition, include the feature so we can download status of others too. thanks.",2517,

This issue has been happening for a long time and is very inconvenient.",2365,
2025-11-20 07:25:07,1,Downgrade to 1 star. I have a couple contacts I like to keep notifications and ringtones SILENT because they always call while I'm working or busy. WhatsApp has seen fit to override my decision by setting their ringtone to to DEFAULT and it isn't even the default I chose. The tone is even more annoying and cannot be undone. All notifications set to silent & still has ring DEFAULT(Alien). One of the last 2 updates changed it to this. FIX IT META!! & stop changing settings as if you know better.,2323,

I remember a similar problem last time I needed a new phone, but I can't believe it's still not fixed!! Also, why can't I share audio mp4 files with whatsapp? Apart from that, whatsapp is a functionally excellent app, but I have concerns about privacy implications and would advise anybody to consider Signal as an alternative.",1784,
2025-10-26 08:10:42,5,"I have been using WhatsApp for over decades, I have never had an issue with it.I haven't found a better app for chatting out there. It makes texting, video calling, voice msging, docs. sharing, doc scanning, pictures, you name it easier. Phone calling? Easy regardless of where the other person is, on earth or not, as long as they have reliable internet, you can talk to them and do the above. There is no need for the highest, most expensive gadgets to do none of that.",1685,
2025-09-24 05:26:45,1,"Frustrating! I took a picture with the WhatsApp camera and did not send it right away. I shortly left the app without closing it, and when I returned to it, my picture was gone and could not be restored. There was no warning message asking if I wanted to discard it; that only appears after you add some text to the picture. Not user-friendly at all!",1648,
2025-09-14 19:29:00,3,"The app is good, but i noticed some issues recently: 1. when i try to answer someone's status with an audio and click ""send"", it doesn't get sent. 2. Some photos aren't opening for other people, even if for me it opens properly, and the same goes for those people who send specific photos, which appear to pop up the message ""This video is not available because something is wrong with the video file."", but it's not even a video, it's a photo.",1584,
2025-11-18 05:47:45,2,"The current WhatsApp PC version feels like a downgrade compared to the earlier one. The new version is slow and often laggy. Chats take time to open, the media doesn’t load properly, and the app freezes randomly. Notifications are inconsistent, and the interface doesn’t feel well-optimized for desktop use. Even the calling experience is unstable and unreliable. Overall, WhatsApp’s updated PC version works for basic messaging, but it’s far behind the previous version.",1414,
2025-09-25 03:22:41,3,"I've used Whatsapp for almost ten years and loved it until Facebook bought it out. I trust Whatsapp. I don't trust Facebook. ever since Facebook took over the app has wanted more and more access to my data, contacts, and permissions. This is no longer my primary app for messaging, and fallen from first to third as better, less intrusive messaging apps have taken its place.

HD quality should also be an option for screenshots that apply high resolutions to the screenshots. this is a feature only accessible to the samsungS series,20,

## Weekly App Review Pulse: Groww Leadership Briefing
**Reporting Period:** Week Ending December 03, 2025

### Executive Summary

*   **Feature Demand Dominates Impact:** The highest Community Impact Score (309.5K votes) is driven by proactive user feedback centered on feature requests (e.g., 'Double Tap to React' and advanced message controls), indicating high engagement but also rising expectations for modern messaging UX.
*   **Critical Performance Bug Identified:** The second most impactful theme (271.2K votes) is a pervasive operational failure related to an update that automatically activated an inescapable clicking/sending sound, which critically bypasses the user's phone silence or vibrate settings, requiring an immediate hotfix.
*   **Core Functionality Regression:** User experience (UX) has deteriorated post-update, specifically concerning media handling (slow, data-intensive downloads and forwards) and key UI changes, leading to significant friction in accessing frequently used features like 'Info and Copy' options.

### Top 5 Themes (Ranked by User Impact)

| Theme Name | Community Impact Score (Total Thumbs Up) | Voice of the Customer | Quote Votes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Other (Feature Requests)** | 309,510 | "You are rolling out the reactions to messages feature, which is good. Could you please introduce the Double Tap feature too, like in Instagram? Also, it would be great if you keep the 'Disappearing Messages' customisable for both the parties." | (Votes: 248,980) |
| **App Bugs & Poor Performance** | 271,211 | "The sound of clicking and sending voice notes got activated automatically after an update and there is no way to turn it down... even if I put it in silence mode where everything is muted, it still makes these sounds!!" | (Votes: 160,474) |
| **Media Quality & Storage** | 179,430 | "The previous versions... were far better. Sharing and forwarding media was easier before... now a days if you download something, then it takes a lot of time and data, also it doesn't get forwarded easily..." | (Votes: 83,327) |
| **Unwanted Features & UI Changes** | 158,755 | "The only issues are: 1) we can no longer tell when audios are heard by receiver... 2) Info and copy options r in a menu instead of shortcut button at top... Makes it inconvenient..." | (Votes: 86,586) |
| **Account Security & Data Loss** | 46,851 | "Horrible horrible app... I can't log into my acct. it keeps showing me an error code after not being able to verify my phone number! I have done everything. sent mails without response." | (Votes: 15,877) |

### Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Emergency Hotfix for Audio Bug:** Due to the severe, inescapable nature of the unwanted audio notifications (Theme: App Bugs), immediately allocate engineering resources to deploy a critical patch within 48 hours to restore user control over application sounds and respect device silence settings.
2.  **Conduct Core Functionality Audit:** Launch an immediate audit focusing on the regression in Media Quality and core UI accessibility. This audit should aim to restore the previous efficiency of media downloading/forwarding and re-evaluate recent UI changes that moved high-frequency actions (like Info/Copy) into inconvenient sub-menus.
3.  **Evaluate High-Demand UX Enhancements:** Leverage the high impact of feature requests (Theme: Other) to inform the Q1 2026 roadmap. Specifically, formally evaluate the technical feasibility and ROI of integrating the 'Double Tap to React' feature and implementing mutually customizable settings for Disappearing Messages to improve modern UX flow.

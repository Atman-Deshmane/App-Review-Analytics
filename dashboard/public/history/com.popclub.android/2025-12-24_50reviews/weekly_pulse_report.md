### 2. Voice of the Customer (Quotes)

*   **On Returns & Refunds:** "WORST customer care. Toughest job to return an item even there is a return policy of the product. I request people who buy the things from pop, \"Buy only if you will not going to return. They will not return easily.\" I have returned two items of same order at the same time. One picked up and other yet not picked up after more than a week. Even though i habe attached all the photos. They will ask for additional form to fill return after doing all these. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎" (Votes: 53)
*   **On Payment Issues:** "Extremely poor experience. Transactions frequently get declined after the money has already been debited from my account, which is completely unacceptable and stressful. Getting refunds takes too long, if they happen at all. On top of that, customer support is unresponsive and unhelpful, offering no real solutions. This app is unreliable and not trustworthy for handling financial transactions. I strongly recommend avoiding it until these serious issues are fixed." (Votes: 16)
*   **On Other (Privacy):** "I requested to not send any messages on WhatsApp and still they keep spamming. I mean this shiuld be basic to nor invade privacy." (Votes: 22)

### 3. Recommended Actions

*   **Audit and reinforce privacy communication protocols:** Investigate the "Other" theme related to WhatsApp spam. Implement stricter opt-in/opt-out procedures for all communication channels and ensure user preferences are respected to maintain trust and prevent privacy violations.
*   **Prioritize stability for payment transactions:** Address the critical "Payment Issues" by investigating the root cause of transaction declines and delayed refunds. This directly impacts user trust and financial security, requiring urgent attention.

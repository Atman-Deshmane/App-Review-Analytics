2025-12-03 23:13:03,5,it's been 1.5 years I am using groww. However since then till now they have improved a lot. They have improved their UI which is very easy for beginners. I prefer this app over any other investment apps coz of it's simple UI. I have invested in stocks and mutual fund through this app as the steps were very easy. A beginner can easily understand how to use this app and even portfolio tracking is also very easy using this app.,3575,
2025-12-03 10:21:37,5,"This platform is user-friendly, with seamless execution for stock trading and investing. I love the detailed market insights and the ability to trade in equity, derivatives, and mutual funds all in one place. Their customer service is top-notch too, making trading stress-free. and very easy to see the sip viewand graph.",3440,
2025-11-28 01:32:38,4,"Very good app,though there is one limitation, that is a 10 year section not available for mutual funds when sorting or viewing any individual funds chart,it is important since it gives more long term perspective,and I would suggest for it to be added.And currently very few bonds available.",435,
2025-11-29 13:49:49,5,it's all good.... pls avail the SL and Target trailing on the chart itself.. coz whenever I go in profit I need to trail the SL n target... and it's very irritating to go through the whole process to be done in a manual way. so pls add that feature.. I need all the features on the chart either it's sl target or dispose the position. it would be a good relief. pls look into this .,321,
2025-11-24 09:39:41,5,I seriously think opening an account with Groww was this easy. A clean and smooth UI and hassle free process - all up and running in half an hour. Even the app is so smooth and easy to navigate. Adding funds was also super smooth. Totally recommend it.,214,
2025-11-29 12:42:17,2,"The app is good, but the call center experience isn’t. I prefer your AI Voice Assistant because it solves my problem in just 30–50 seconds. In a human call, I first have to enter my date of birth, then select options based on my issue, and only after that do I get connected to a representative. The whole process takes around 7–8 minutes. The speed should be faster. In the end, my problem was solved. Thank you.",143,
2025-11-22 20:05:42,1,"only good for long time for others it is worst app.. i lost alot of money by using this app.. some time refreshing some time not exicute etc.. many problems are there in this app.. and you see more profit on your PL, But when you exit it it will less than the first amount and when you see the loss amount on your PL when exit it the loss amout is more than when you see first... if you put a target number the target will hit only the target number cross above not will hit even reach the target.",104,
2025-12-04 09:25:42,2,I like the simplicity of the app but the dashboard seems messy if we have multiple funds of different categories. there is no way to group or see funds under certain categories.,68,
2025-11-27 14:34:16,4,"Showing events in single place is a great update. One suggestion, it would be nice to be able add & edit notes in MF/SIP, since everyone might have a reason for joining each SIP. Also, along with 52 week prof, dividend would be a good reference.",67,
2025-11-29 09:36:24,5,"I've been investing in this app for more than three years. I've earned and lost money in the market, and it's taught me a lot. However, investing with Groww has helped me grow. I'll rate trust 10/10.",64,
2025-11-30 11:05:58,5,this option chain is not better..so please give old option chain with change in oi and total oi.. there is no proper dispay in new option chain..so please change it. Thanka for adding new feature of oi in groww.ita superb..and u should display on mobile apps because of so much user trading through mobile..if u can do this..pls see oi on mobile groww apps..,63,
2025-11-28 23:06:31,1,"Too late response in option trading.. Even after setting the stop loss at a particular price, it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss. And on top of that the hidden charges ..Resulting P&L shows different after the day and when the amount reflects it is always lower and then unnecessary deductions. There is always 200-500 rs difference than what actually should have been received deducted in the name of charges other than execution charges.",57,
2025-12-03 12:15:36,5,Groww More Ratings: Brokerage - Excellent Account Maintenance Fees - Excellent Website Usability - Excellent Research Capabilities - Excellent Customer Service - Excellent,55,
2025-11-26 11:57:59,5,Groww is best of all trading apps that I have as of now. It has awesomely supported me in my trading journey so far. I will definitely support it to anyone without hesitation.,48,
2025-12-03 16:03:27,1,"Useless, Suspicious, pretentious, irresponsible activities are being done by it's staff members. WhyCYBERCRIME.GOV.IN, SEBI, CONSUMER COURT, eDAAKHILA.GOV.IN are there ? Worst, irresponsible customer support personnels. Is Groww a SCAM ! Very very unpleasant experiences. Some staff members are leaking investors personal sensitive data, why ? In this way, Groww is going to loose it's authenticity & goodwill very soon. Why appointing such staff who're harrassing thy customers ? Is GROWW a FRAUD !!",43,
2025-12-05 14:36:02,1,"This is a good app but crashes frequently. Many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses. Please resolve this issue.",34,
2025-12-05 14:22:23,1,Dual apps / Clone apps support not available on oppo reno 14 pro.,26,
2025-11-29 15:31:43,2,"The brokerage rates are attractive, but the app has usability issues, instead if showing the dashboard after login, the app shows explore, in MF section, the executed orders do not show buying NAV rate and Units allocated. in Stocks there are more problems which cannot be written due to words limits.",22,
2025-11-24 18:42:48,1,"Reasons for low rating 1. Top Mutual Fund invested info in the stock is missing - fixed thank you Edit 2 22nd Mar: 2. Why do all Indexes like Nifty smallcap 100, Nifty PSE, and Nifty microcap 250 are not shown in the app under indices section? Edit 3 24th Nov - Can we have an option to view family accounts, I keep logging out from one account to check the other?",22,
2025-11-27 14:24:37,1,Why trade value of stock is not added in mobile application as it is present in desktop version even though their is proper space for that. I would like to request to add that small feature in mobile version so that I could change my rating. I'm not asking for much technical features I just want a feature which is already present in Groww. Hope this would be helpful for other users as well. I would be waiting for your response.,21,
2025-12-02 12:02:31,1,Groww Customer Support I am waiting for a response from Customer Support chat for the last 15 minutes to my query but no reply. This is unprofessional and poor customer service,16,
2025-12-01 13:41:59,1,too much CHARGES and TAXES. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks.! worst experience I have been using thinking getting profits for trading but everything is loss when you use trade buy sell stocks through Grow.! advice you to not use grow. better there are a lot of platforms! compare others but don't come to grow. even upstox is also useless it charges montly and yearly charges. better go for zeroda.,16,
2025-12-05 14:32:53,5,"Please add real time total portfolio percentage of profit or loss for 24×7 like upstox, instead of sending portfolio alert day to day & there is bug in wishlist also i.e our portfolio stocks in wishlist show 0.00% change every time on interface while the reality after opening individual stock is different.",13,
2025-11-26 20:47:28,4,"Please upgrade your groww chart (1-Tap Scalper Mode), very difficult to add or remove any tools lines, trendline etc, also need to add more indicators (Pivot Point Standard) for which many times I talked to customer care, raised ticket but not added yet. I must suggest, instead of groww chart, add 1-Tap Scalper mode to normal Trading View Chart...like Dhan App, you can take the reference.",11,
2025-11-30 14:00:32,5,"I am using this app from last many years, it is very easy to use and the service is also good.",7,
2025-11-26 23:54:27,5,"Dev team, you must ask confirmation when we're enabling/disabling a certain feature. It is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services. It seems intentional and is in poor taste. Please have this fixed.",7,
2025-11-26 17:43:44,4,"Like in the Dhan app, when you add a stock to the watchlist, the price should be saved there so that in the future you can know what the price of that stock was when you added it to the watchlist.",6,
2025-12-03 18:09:30,3,"Please add that lets you see the holdings of the mutual fund. Also stocks holding page is way too ineffecient, requiring numerous taps to see P&L and current share price change, its a hassle if there are too many stocks, and yes the about section of a company should include summery of what company actually does.",5,
